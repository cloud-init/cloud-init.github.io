 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` community-notice: office hours meeting  starts now. We host this meeting time every two weeks for any drop in discussions for anything cloud-init related. Bring your bugs, feature discussions, gripes and questions and we'll have a couple sets of upstream cloud-init eyes on this channel to field those discussions.

 17:29 `<blackboxsw>` highlights of recent upstream commits and project changes are at the url below:

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` Of course, if you managed to join us over here you are already aware of the Freenode IRC politcal climate pushing us to migrate to a more open/friendly IRC network w/ libera.chat.  paride is in the process of registering this channel for the cloud-init project so that we can add channel OPS to the upstream cloud-init committers smoser, rharper, Odd_Bloke, falcojr.

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` Once we have channel op status, we plan on adding upcoming dates, milestones and info to the IRC channel title.

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` Also, as upstream, we want to rename the default development branch from 'master' to 'main' to provide more inclusive naming and drop antiquated and exclusive naming conventions. An email will be sent to the cloud-init mailing list explaining the perceived impact of such a default branch rename (which should be minimal).

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` If there are any concerns about this rename impacting business, please raise concerns here, on the discourse  post above or on the mailinglist
