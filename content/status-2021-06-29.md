 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` Hi cloud-init devs, Our biweekly office hours meeting has begun. We keep this channel open during the designated time on the channel \#topic for drop in questions, feature or bug discussions and prodding committers folks for reviews.

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` All questions welcome and we'll have a couple of upstream committers with eyes on the channel to field any discussions brought up as best we can.

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` Just prior to this meeting, someone will post recent happenings in cloud-init upstream which may be of value to the community.

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` As far as upstream is concerned, the only schedule detail of note is we are looking to create an official 21.3 upstream release August 28th. Before that time we hope to have some hot plug network device handling functional in cloud-init.

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` my plan today is to get falcojr a review on his foundational hotplug support work at [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/919](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/919) which should allow cloud-init to support actively interacting with network config utilities to actively enable individual interfaces on device discovery after the network renderers have finished initial network bringup.

 16:34 `<ubottu>` Pull 919 in canonical/cloud-init "Add new network configurers to bring up interfaces (SC-85)" [Open]

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` ok, that wraps things up for "office hours" for today. Thanks for checking in.
