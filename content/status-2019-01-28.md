 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` hi cloud-init folks, it's that happy time again to chat about cloud-init upstream.

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` Generally the topics we cover in this status meeting are: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, and Office hours

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` previously we had an action to review  [https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/356098.](https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/356098.) I think rharper and robjo have a couple of back and forths on this branch. looks like we'll be able to land this

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` and oh noes, we need to followup  and resolve the following MD bug on OpenStack [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1801364](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1801364)

 16:32 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1801364 in cloud-init "persisting OpenStack metadata fails" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` \#action carry over blackboxsw close and land Openstack metadata handling bug [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1801364](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1801364)

 16:32 `<robjo>` Well that one was just about an additional empty line which I removed in October

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` ok I'll spend the 2nd half of this meeting going through this again and landing it if no other concerns. \#toostale seeing [https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/356098](https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/356098)

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` it doesn't look on review that there is anything concerning there.

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` robjo: oops autolander rejection, will fix the LP commit message now and make approved (for merging)

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` Server Team CI bot (server-team-bot) wrote on 2019-01-07: 	\#

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` Commit message lints:

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` - Expected empty line on line 2 of the commit message

 16:37 `<robjo>` Can there not be a template in LP for the commit message?

 16:38 `<robjo>` I can never remember the formatting intricacies and thus depend on one of you guys to set this

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` robjo: does the 'commit message' on the merge proposal look good to you now [https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/357710](https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/357710)
