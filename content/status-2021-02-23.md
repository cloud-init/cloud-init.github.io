 17:19 `<blackboxsw>` community notice: hi folks. We are resuming our much anticipated office hours. Every two weeks at this time. The IRC topic will host our upcoming expected office-hours meeting time.

 17:19 `<blackboxsw>` \o Odd_Bloke thx

 17:19 `<blackboxsw>` t

 17:20 `<blackboxsw>` This meeting will provide an opportunity with multiple upstream cloud-init devs available to discuss bugs, features, ongoing development or answer your existential questions :)

 17:20 `<blackboxsw>` We hope to continue this meeting with regular cadence (and calendar reminders) to make sure we hold this time and frequency.

 17:22 `<blackboxsw>` I'll send an email to the mailing list (again) announcing this cadence. Again this time if for any discussions, questions or dev/feature topics that folks would like to gab about.

 17:23 `<blackboxsw>` We just published a high-level update of what's been happening in the cloud-init space, [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cloud-init-status-02-23-2021/21069.](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cloud-init-status-02-23-2021/21069.)

 17:25 `<blackboxsw>` As seen on the mailinglist, Odd_Bloke and falcojr have been trying to tidy up things for the upstream 21.1 timed release. Thanks both of you for driving this work. I believe 21.1 landed, was uploaded to Ubuntu 21.04 (Hirsute).

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` We are also planning on SRUing(StableReleaseUpdate - Ubuntu-speak for uploading) 21.1 plus a feature fix for OVS support into Xenial, Bionic, Focal and Groovy within the next week or two.

 17:26 `<Odd_Bloke>` Yep, I'm currently working through the release announcement process.

 17:30 `<blackboxsw>` great Dan. So, TLDR is watch the mailinglist cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net and discourse [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server/cloud-init](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server/cloud-init) for announcements and updates

 17:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server/cloud-init](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server/cloud-init)

 17:58 `<blackboxsw>` I think we've about rounded out the office-hours. (I spent that time walking through a sopel-irc bot setup to test out some of the features to see if we can't add some structure to this office-hours engagement (and frankly release announcements too )

 17:59 `<blackboxsw>` Let's set that next office hours for +2 weeks-45 mins from now

 18:00 `<blackboxsw>` hopefully by then we have an automated announcer kicking off the notification.

 18:00 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks all!

 18:00 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
