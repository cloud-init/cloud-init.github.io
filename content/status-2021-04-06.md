 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting cloud-init bi-weekly office-hours

 16:20 `<meetingology>` Meeting started at 16:20:26 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw.  Information about MeetBot at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology)

 16:20 `<meetingology>` Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 16:21 `<falcojr>` I think by default it should use the current defaults of what's chosen...e.g., true for rhel and false for others

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` Hi cloud-init! This marks another episode of cloud-init community office hours. This time is an opportunity to discuss any cloud-init questions, bugs or topics with cloud-init upstream developers. We try to ensure a couple of devs have eyes on this channel to field any questions/concerns folks may have.

 16:24 `<Odd_Bloke>` o/

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` Recent happenings in cloud-init space are generally spent on the current SRU validation with Odd_Bloke and falcojr. It looks like we've cleared the last manual validation with that SRU and we will be waiting on a significant automated set of tests to pass before making this release public.

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` thanks falcojr and Odd_Bloke for reviews on [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/859](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/859)

 16:36 `<hamalq>` i already did the change as the comment

 16:37 `<hamalq>` i dont think i can change cloudinit/distros/__init__.py  select_hostname though

 16:38 `<falcojr>` we can change it...we just need to make sure the functionality stays the same if the option isn't specified

 16:39 `<hamalq>` thats the point since the default for that option is true

 16:40 `<hamalq>` unless we make the default for it false for other distros

 16:41 `<falcojr>` yes, we would need to take it into account for all distros, and it would default to false for most

 16:42 `<hamalq>` +1

 16:47 `<hamalq>` i changed that now for distros and rhel

 17:15 `<hamalq>` i think i got the changes required [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/859](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/859)

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` thanks folks for attending the office hours. See you all in two weeks. Same time

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
