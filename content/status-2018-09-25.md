 16:06 `<blackboxsw>` Hi cloud-init folks, time to kickoff our bi-weekly(ish) status meeting. As mentioned on the mailing list we pushed this meeting out until today so we could have a discussion about the 18.4 upstream release which is scheduled for this Thursday.

 16:07 `<blackboxsw>` I just updated the topic to reflect the 18.4 release date, Sept 27th EOD.

 16:08 `<blackboxsw>` for today's meeting we have the following agenda:  Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress development and 18.4 release discussion/office hours/ (~30 minutes)

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:12 `<blackboxsw>` Last week, we had some travel and planning discussions for cloud-init which took a few cycles out of our upstream landed content, but we were able to review and land a few items over the last couple weeks. Below is the list of changes that have landed in upstream cloud-init master. I expect we'll publish 18.4 release this week to Ubuntu Cosmic, so any changes below will be present in our next public release.

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` Thank you again Robert, Thomas and Fabian for continued contributions to cloud-init upstream. Things are looking really good for the upcoming release

 16:15 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-Progress development

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` We are beating the drum toward the 18.4 release, as such, we are going to focus more on low-risk changes and bug fixes as we close in on the 18.4 upstream cutoff.

 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` All of the work we have planned lives over on our trello board.

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` In our doing and review lane I expect we'll have a couple branches landing for standardizing and generalizing /run/cloud/instance-data.json on all clouds, and a couple of new cloud-init CLI commands  'cloud-init query' and 'cloud-id' to surface standardized instance-data on any cloud platform

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` post-18.4 release rharper has been doing some excellent work adding hotplug network support to OpenStack. I expect we'll be landing his branches shortly after we cut 18.4

 16:21 `<rharper>` blackboxsw: thanks; it's been super interesting

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` this should give us an excellent example of reacting to changing metadata on a given platform, which hopefully other datasources will be able to adopt.

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` As far as additional content for the release, I'll also be circling an email around to the mailing list (cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net ) to describe existing instance data that cloud-init publishes. We are looking for input on common instance meta data that folks would like to see generalized across clouds.

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` I think about wraps up our current dev tasks.

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic 18.4 Release Schedule

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` As mentioned earlier, we would like to cut 18.4 upstream release and tag it at end of day on Thursday, Sept 27th.

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` We will be looking at the active review queue for any branches with the 'Needs review' status.

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/master/+activereviews](https://code.launchpad.net/~cloud-init-dev/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/master/+activereviews)

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` If there are branches or bugs that you think need attention, please don't hesitate to mail the mailing list, or ping in this channel to get attention

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` After thursday, we'll be performing some additional  manual and automated integration tests and we will plan on publishing 18.4 to Ubuntu Cosmic.

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` As a service, we also will publish that 18.4 release to the following copr repo for those centos-inclined individuals :)

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/el-testing/](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/el-testing/)

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` For each upstream release we sync that release to the 'el-testing' repo.

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` Daily upstream snapshots are also available at [https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/cloud-init-dev/](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/cloud-init-dev/)

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` I think that about wraps the fire hose of content for our meeting. For the next 30 mins we should have eyes on this channel to discuss the finer points of life as well as anything cloud-init related. Bring your bugs, gripes, requests, reviews and/or discussions and we'll get a good answer for you.

 16:33 * blackboxsw is going to hitup the review queue at the moment so see if there are some cloud-init branches we can clear out.

 16:45 `<rharper>` +1

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` ok that about wraps it for today.

 17:10 `<blackboxsw>` minutes will be published to the following link. Thanks again folks! See you next time
