 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` At long last, and a bit late. Time for a brief cloud-init status meeting

 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` Coud-init upstream uses this meeting as a platform for community updates, feature/bug discussions, and an opportunity to get some extra input on current development.

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` You can always find the next date and time of the cloud-init status meeting in the topic of this channel.

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` it also serves as a reminder to me that we need to start it as I find it's easy to forget the appointment if it isn't staring us in the face.

 17:46 `<blackboxsw>` Let's set next meeting now

 17:48 `<blackboxsw>` our previous meeting minutes are recorded on our  github site

 17:49 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/](https://cloud-init.github.io/)

 17:49 `<blackboxsw>` the topics we cover in this meeting are the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Community Charter, Upcoming Meetings, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` Previous  \#ACTION bbsw seed initial community charter bitesize bugs   ... DONE.

 17:51 `<blackboxsw>` 'bitesize' bugs for cloud-init can be found at the following link

 17:51 `<blackboxsw>` \#link bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs?field.tag=bitesize

 17:52 `<blackboxsw>` These bugs should be easy to work in parallel as well as self-contained bits of work that any member of the community could approach as a small chunk of work

 17:53 `<blackboxsw>` we moved from using trello board for tracking these tasks to using launchpad bugs as it eases the ability to search and grab ownership of the specific features/bugs

 17:53 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 17:57 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 17:58 `<blackboxsw>` FreeBSD, NetBSD improvements are under heavy development, thanks meena and Goneri for all the PRs put of in that regard.

 17:58 `<blackboxsw>` Also robjo has started work on cleanup of sysconfig net rendering per [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/162](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/162) and a mailing list discussion

 17:59 `<blackboxsw>` rharper is also midstream on "cloud-init run as a daemon" mode [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/48](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/48)   which should improve cloud-init startup times by avoiding having to reload python 4 times for each cloud-init stage

 18:00 `<blackboxsw>` Also in progress, upstream has started to SRU testing for cloud-init 19.4.33 into Ubuntu Xenial, Bionic and Eoan.

 18:01 `<blackboxsw>` We expect to wrap up that testing this week for a publish of cloud-init 19.4.33 to those series

 18:02 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 18:02 `<blackboxsw>` As a note, any community member is welcome to participate in SRU testing of cloud-init if those changesets in the SRU affect your cloud platform or features.

 18:02 `<blackboxsw>` We have added a guide for SRU testing on Ubuntu here

 18:03 `<tribaal>` duly noted :)

 18:03 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/debugging.html\#manual-sru-verification-procedure](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/debugging.html\#manual-sru-verification-procedure)

 18:03 `<blackboxsw>` :)

 18:04 `<blackboxsw>` ahh tribaal we should pull in your PR for manual testing of Exoscale too if you think it's ready [https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/pull/64](https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/pull/64)

 18:04 `<tribaal>` it's not unfortunately :/

 18:05 `<blackboxsw>` ahh, ok *good*, thought it was waiting on review

 18:05 `<blackboxsw>` ok can table that for another SRU (which will be around Feb 14th likely)

 18:06 `<tribaal>` no worries, happy to help test the current one anyway

 18:06 `<blackboxsw>` community notice: we are targeting Feb 18th as our cutoff for upstream cloud-init version 20.1 (which will be SRU'd to Ubuntu Xenial, bionic and Eoan). If there are features  of bug fixes that you'd like to get into cloud-init 20.1 please raise them as PRs or discussion on the mailinglist or in channel

 18:08 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 18:08 `<blackboxsw>` This time is spent on any cloud-init feature/bug/branch discussions. quetions or concerns and topics are welcome. In the absence of topics we'll groom the review queue.

 18:09 `<blackboxsw>` I'm wrapping up some significant change suggestions the networking stuff for sysconfig on [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/162](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/162)

 18:10 `<blackboxsw>` I should have that review done in about an hour

 18:10 `<blackboxsw>` I've added myself as the "assignee" to that PR to indicate it as priority for me

 18:11 `<blackboxsw>` also, note in SRU testing  I've run into a repeated issue with cloud-init's ssh-import-id  taking 1 minute to import a single ssh pubkey on Azure bionic advanced networking vms. (2 nics + ipv6 + multiple IPs).  I'll be debugging this a bit today to make sure it is not a regression for this cloud-init SRU 19.4.33

 18:12 `<blackboxsw>` if anyone has any feedback or issues associated with this cloud-init v 19.4.33 SRU, they can comment on the SRU bug or raise a new bug or comment in IRC

 18:12 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1859725](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1859725)

 18:12 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1859725 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "sru cloud-init (19.3.41 to 19.4.33) Xenial, Bionic and Eoan" [Undecided,New]

 18:55 `<blackboxsw>` ok, that about wraps today's status meeting. We'll have the next one February 4th to chat again about getting features ready for 20.1

 18:55 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks for tuning in.
