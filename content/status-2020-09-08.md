 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting cloud-init status meeting

 16:18 `<meetingology>` Meeting started Tue Sep  8 16:18:47 2020 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw. Information about MeetBot at [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.)

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` hey folks. welcome to another public cloud-init status meeting

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` disclaimer: interruptions and side conversations are welcome

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` We use this platform/channel to discuss latest and greatest cloud-init, as well as ensuring that there are a couple of upstream developers present to field questions or discussion as needed.

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` We gather here in this IRC channel every 2 weeks to discuss current development tasks and progress on cloud-init.

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` Previous meeting minutes are here;

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2020-08-25.html\#status-2020-08-25](https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2020-08-25.html\#status-2020-08-25)

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` The topics we'll cover today: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Community Charter, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` I expect today will be short as the entire Canonical team is involved in cloud-init SRU verification for Ubuntu at the moment

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` last meeting had an action item we needed to resolve

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` bbsw add workitem to SRU release process to announce to mailinglist estimated next SRU timeframe.

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` this item can be resolved as I've added the content requested to our email template which will be sent out once this SRU completes.

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` I see no other actions from last meeting

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` The following are upstream commits landed in cloud-init's master branch:

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/NgqncRMG9c/](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/NgqncRMG9c/)

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` In the last couple of weeks we cut the upstream 20.3 release (thanks everyone for all the help there).  Queued SRU uploads for ubuntu/xenial, bionic and focal release testing.

 16:28 `<amansi26>` blackboxsw: metadata here will be the configdrive, if my understanding is right?

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` And added some goodness to systemd units and ordering (sort systemd cloud-init-local.service hv_kvp_daemon and systemd: add Before=shutdown.target when Conflicts=shutdown.target is

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` used )

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` thanks paride and robjo for those commits

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` amansi26: +1 you can see the metadata configured hostname from cloud-init query local-hostname I think

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` amansi26: +1 you can see the metadata configured hostname from `cloud-init query local-hostname` I think

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` amansi26: I was just starting to respond to your bug you linked too

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` I think preserve_hostname: false (which is cloud-init's default behavior )  means cloud-init will read that hostname from metadata and apply it to the system

 16:31 `<amansi26>` Sure. there is another bug which I observed on a RHEL8 environment: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1894837](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1894837)

 16:31 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1894837 in cloud-init "RHEL8 ipv4 IPs not getting set" [Undecided,New]

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` amansi26: sorry cloud-init query local_hostname   (\# not with a hyphen)

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` checking 2nd bug

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` so amansi26 you'd like the ability to override the iface_defaults on rhel systems for NM_CONTROLLED to set  True instead of false for cloud-init interfaces?

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` generally if cloud-init is rendering network configuration on an instance, it tries to avoid using network manager by default. I think it's worth requesting logs on  your bug

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` those cloud-init logs can be obtained using cloud-init collect-logs (which generates a tar.gz file in the current working directory). then attach that to the bug

 16:41 `<amansi26>` yes, since I was reading the documentation for RHEL8 network configuration, I found that NM_CONTROLLED = yes should be there. but we are passing the value as No.  Sure I will attach the logs to the defect

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` thanks amansi26 I responded on that bug too

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` Ok, per the meeting,  that wraps \#recent-changes topic I believe

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` Currently the Canonical team is working hard on SRU verification so we can release cloud-init v. 20.3 to Xenial, Bionic and Focal. It looks like we are done with most major cloud verification and walking through individual verification items.

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` I believe falcojr mentioned this morning we are about 5 of 30ish verification items complete.

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` we are continuing to work this verification as our top priority

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` folks interested should subscribe to updates on our SRU bug

 16:51 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1893064](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1893064)

 16:51 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1893064 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "sru cloud-init (20.2-45 to 20.3-2) Xenial, Bionic, and Focal" [Undecided,In progress]

 16:53 `<blackboxsw>` that bug will transition to verification-complete once all verification is done

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` The following topics are still topics for ongoing community development anyone new to cloud-init, or with a bit of time could easily grab one of these bitesized tasks:

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` JSON schema extensions to validate user-data before instance launch: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/)?field.tag=bitesize

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` - cloudinit.net refactor into distro-specific networking subclasses cloudinit.distros.networking: [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs)?field.tag=net-refactor

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` If anyone would like to be involved more than they currently are, please feel free to contact us here in IRC \#cloud-init on Freenode or on the mailing list cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net and we can see how best we can get you "set up"

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:55 `<blackboxsw>` this time of the meeting is really just an open door for any discussions, concerns, bugs, questions or general prodding of upstream devs to make sure existing development work is unblocked where possible.

 16:55 `<blackboxsw>` in absence of discussions. We actually will be focused on SRU verification tasks today.

 16:56 `<blackboxsw>` each of these verification logs and scripts are pushed as pull requests  to [https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/pulls](https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/pulls)

 17:13 `<blackboxsw>` ok I think that about wraps today's session. Next meeting will be in two weeks, but we'll likely see you in channel earlier.

 17:13 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
