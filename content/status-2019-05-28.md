 15:23 `<blackboxsw>` there we go

 15:24 `<blackboxsw>` Hey folks, time for another bi-weekly cloud-init status.  Welcome all!

 15:25 `<blackboxsw>` Generally cloud-init upstream uses this meeting to provide a platform for status updates, raising questions or concerns and feature discussion. All are encouraged to participate as you see fit.

 15:25 `<blackboxsw>` Generally the topics we would like to cover are the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Office Hours

 15:26 `<blackboxsw>` without further ado let's jump into it.

 15:27 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 15:27 `<blackboxsw>` From our previous meeting minutes we had a couple of action items that I think are resolved

 15:27 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2019-05-13.html\#status-2019-05-13](https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2019-05-13.html\#status-2019-05-13)

 15:28 * blackboxsw Odd_Bloke confirm correct status of [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1801364](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1801364)

 15:28 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1801364 in cloud-init "persisting OpenStack metadata fails" [Undecided,Confirmed]

 15:28 `<blackboxsw>` Dan confirmed that this is the proper bug status and still needs a fix

 15:28 `<blackboxsw>` AnhVoMSFT: we had an action related to you "followup on recommended approach for getting kernel/userspace timestamp with or without python-dbus package dependency"

 15:29 `<blackboxsw>` I know rharper had a comment or two in channel about this approach. Hopefully AnhVoMSFT you have everything you need there

 15:29 `<blackboxsw>` if not, you can feel free to ping us for more discussion on that feature

 15:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent changes

 15:31 `<blackboxsw>` Big news since last bi-weekly status meeting is that we have completed and published 19.1.1 in an SRU into Ubuntu Xenial, Bionic, Cosmic and Disco as of yesterday.

 15:31 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: wrote up some content and email around this for more context. Thanks Odd_Bloke

 15:38 `<blackboxsw>` beyond that we have the following upstream commits landed

 15:39 `<blackboxsw>` d9b1e5de91..HEAD | log2dch

 15:40 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks again Jason and Gonéri for the commits there. We have a few branches in the wings under review for freebsd and azure that I expect will be landing this week

 15:42 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 15:43 `<blackboxsw>` Our upcoming work is set and scheduled on this trello board above. As we grab new significant tasks and dev work for cloud-init we will pull those cards into the doing lane

 15:44 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office hours (next ~30 mins)

 15:45 `<blackboxsw>` This topic is an opportunity for anyone to bring their bugs, features, questions or branches to get some extra eyes or discussion around current development.

 15:47 `<blackboxsw>` It is also a slot of time where upstream developers will be spending some time reviewing active branches to unblock community members and help increase velocity of our review queue.

 15:47 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+activereviews](https://code.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+activereviews)

 15:52 `<akik>` ls

 15:52 `<akik>` sorry

 16:03 `<blackboxsw>` yeah this looks good Goneri [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/367315...](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/367315...) approved

 16:14 `<blackboxsw>` just approved with a nit if you are around to push that. if not, I'll get that doc branch merged in tomorrow
