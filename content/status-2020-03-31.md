 16:19 `<meetingology>` Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` Hello and welcome to another cloud-init community status meeting folks. please feel free to continue any current conversations

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` I'll interleave status meeting notes with existing conversations.

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair Odd_Bloke smoser rharper

 16:20 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: Odd_Bloke blackboxsw rharper smoser

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` our IRC channel topic carries the next planned status meeting for those that wish to participate.  All are welcome to interject or drive converstation topics here

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` let's set that now. to +2 weeks from now

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` April 14th, same time

 16:21 `<shibumi>` rharper: thanks!

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` Previous meeting notes are here

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2020-03-10.html\#status-2020-03-10](https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2020-03-10.html\#status-2020-03-10)

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` The topics we generally cover in this meeting are the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Community Charter, Upcoming Meetings, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` and from last meeting, no previous actions were unaccounted for.

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` recent changes landed in tip of master via git log --since 2020-03-10

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/55hqVCfnpV/](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/55hqVCfnpV/)

 16:24 `<rharper>` shibumi: also, the issue with openstack metadata service not being found is likely related to classless statci route support in the EphemeralDHCP class in cloud-init, we fixed an issue there last fall,  [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/commit/07b17236be5665bb552c7460102bcd07bf8f2be8](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/commit/07b17236be5665bb552c7460102bcd07bf8f2be8)

 16:24 `<rharper>` shibumi: long term, we would like to replace dhclient with a python-based one;  we've just not had a change to implement a minimal dhclient in python only

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` in that paste or recent changes, some big items have landed since last we 'met':   both NetBSD and OpenBSD distro support is now added to cloud-init. vmware support of guest info gc status, SAP Converged cloud gets identified as OpenStack and Ubuntu Focal prioritizing netplan over ifupdown if both are present

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` Also Odd_Bloke has been landing and improving cloud-init automated process with near daily branches. github actions/workflows and docs about review and coding style expectations are landing to make it a lot easier for upstream to help speed contributions and reviews

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` Also, you'll note a lot of dropping python six and other py2-related artifacts from our codebase. Since upstream support is py3.4 or later we can simplify and prune a lot of the vestigial py2 functionality.

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` Ahh I also forgot, Ec2 now by default (Ubuntu Focal or tip of cloud-init) renders  full networking, including secondary IPv4/IPv6 addresses, for all interfaces attached to a VM based on network config supplied by IMDS. Old releases of cloud-init used to only render basic networking on the primary (eth0) nic.

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` thanks Goneri and meena for all your the BSD ongoing development and support work  there BTW

 16:33 * Goneri waves

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` :)     upstream is focused a bit on continuing to clean up py2 remnants from tip, adding support for reading netplan configuration from initramfs and continuing to add automation to the github development and release process/tooling to speed reviews.

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` we are also hammering the review queue a bit better than in the past with daily PR assignments to ensure the system remains more efficient

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` thanks again for all the code submits folks!

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` waiting In the wings we will eventually get around to handling the network hotplug solution for cloud-init (if configured)

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic  Community Charter

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` This section is generally reserved to discuss any general community goals for cloud-init. Per last cloud-init summit we discussed prioritizing the following:

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` * json schema validation for each cloudinit/config/cc_*py module

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` * correcting, extending stale datasource documentation under doc/rtd/topics/datasources

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` those tasks are easy to split up and so we set a goal to try to chunk through it this year

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` they are also categorized as bugs for easy pickup/assignment for anyone interested.

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs)?field.tag=bitesize

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` thanks for listening to the above......   In this section a couple upstream devs should be available with eyes on the channel for the next 30 minutes for and bug, feature, PR review questions or concerns.

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` again thanks for joining. We'll have this meeting again in 2 weeks

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` I'm going to spend this time working on our cherry-pick script for publishing the Netplan ->` ENI work into Ubuntu Focal today.

 17:17 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks for tuning in.
