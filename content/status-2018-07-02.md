 16:06 `<blackboxsw>` hi folks, just kicking off another cloud-init status meeting to communicate the recent events in cloud-init land.

 16:06 `<blackboxsw>` welcome to all, feel free to interrupt as we go through the agenda. As always cloud-init status minutes will live at the following url

 16:07 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/](https://cloud-init.github.io/)

 16:07 `<blackboxsw>` The meeting agenda is as follows:

 16:08 `<blackboxsw>` agenda: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress develepment and office hours (~30 minutes)

 16:09 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:09 `<blackboxsw>` Last meeting we have a couple of actions to look over:

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` \#ACTION blackboxsw carryover network hotplug vs network maintenance on reboot-only

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` \#ACTION blackboxsw carryover network hotplug vs network maintenance on reboot-only [DONE]

 16:11 `<blackboxsw>` we held multiple meetings, including discussion with mgerdts on a SmartOS solution for handling regenerating network configuration per-boot when a user selects this behavior

 16:12 `<blackboxsw>` We have just landed a supporting branch in cloud-init tip to enable datasources to define what events (BOOT vs BOOT_NEW_INSTANCE) they will react to when generating network config.

 16:12 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/348000](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/348000)

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` that should give a foundation for other datasources to write/change network config across boots, instead of allowing network config to remain static based on cloud-init's initial network configuration

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` the 2nd action ..

 16:14 `<blackboxsw>` I'd like to carry this one over. We got a bit bogged down in SRU, CentOs stuff last week and we shold be able to get some eyes on this branch

 16:14 `<blackboxsw>` I think that's it for actions.

 16:15 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` Below is a list of changes landed in cloud-init tip or package publishing that has occured for the project:

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` * our 18.3 release was cut from tip if you caught the email on that mailing list

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` Congrats all for a great effort at improving quality and adding more datasource/cloud support

 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00164.html](https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00164.html)

 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` ^ in case you didn't get the message

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` * we also publish 18.3 release into Ubuntu Cosmic and started a stable release update (SRU) to publish 18.3 in to xenial, artful, bionic

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` published*

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` expectations are that xenial, artful and bionic will have 18.3 after this week of testing

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` the remaining changes landed in tip are:

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - update_metadata: a datasource can support network re-config every boot

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` [Chad Smith]

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - tests: drop salt-minion integration test (LP: \#1778737)

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - Retry on failed import of gpg receive keys.

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - tools: Fix run-container when neither source or binary package requested.

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - docs: Fix a small spelling error. [Oz N Tiram]

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - tox: use simplestreams from git repository rather than bzr.

 16:20 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1778737 in cloud-init "salt-minion test needs fixing" [Undecided,Fix committed] [https://launchpad.net/bugs/1778737](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1778737)

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - release 18.3 [Chad Smith] (LP: \#1777743)

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - docs: represent sudo:false in docs for user_groups config module

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` [Chad Smith]

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` - Explicitly prevent `sudo` access for user module

 16:20 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1777743 in cloud-init "Release 18.3" [Undecided,Fix released] [https://launchpad.net/bugs/1777743](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1777743)

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` [Jacob Bednarz] (LP: \#1771468)

 16:20 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1771468 in cloud-init "Allow a way to explicitly disable sudo for a user" [Undecided,Fix released] [https://launchpad.net/bugs/1771468](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1771468)

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` next topic

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` Our ongoing development is always listed publicly at the following trello board

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` We are going to be focused on SRU validation for Ubuntu this week which should take up the majority of the week.

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` At the end of this SRU process we will also rebuild centos binaries in our copr repo

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/el-testing/](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/el-testing/)

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` so that folks in other envs will have access to latest bits if their distro/cloud doesn't have that update

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` Also, specfic to mgerdts  and danMS_ there is a branch in progress for Azure support to regenerate network-config for all interfaces on each boot.

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/348704](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/348704)

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` mgerdts: might like it only as another example of a datasource managing network config across boots

 16:26 `<mgerdts>` Thanks.  Will look at that soon.

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` no prob, sorry for all the pings :)

 16:26 `<danMS_>` will take a look too and spk to paulmey

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` also smoser is working on implementing an OCIC datasource (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic)

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` think that wraps it up for this week.

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` there should be a couple of eyes on this channel for discusssions, questions, bug requests etc that might need a bit more attention.

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` again, thanks for tuning in and helping make cloud-init better!

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` meeting minutes will ultimately show at
