 17:21 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: blackboxsw, falcojr

 17:25 `<blackboxsw>` We just published a little discourse post describing that cloud-init upstream version 21.2 has now cleared SRU validation for Ubuntu Bionic(16.04) Focal (20.04) Groovy (20.10) and Hirsute (21.04) [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cloud-init-status-06-15-2021/22730](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cloud-init-status-06-15-2021/22730)

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` in that SRU, were some ssh_key handling improvement, Azure SSH key processing, Azure userdata updated ingested from IMDS and new support for Vultr cloud platform.

 17:27 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks all for those contributions!

 17:30 `<blackboxsw>` one other interesting thing to note: 4 days ago I was banned from FreeNode. falcojr did this happen to you too? "Connection closed unexpectedly: You are banned from this server- [\#1480] Contact support@freenode.net (2021/6/11 05.18):"

 17:31 `<falcojr>` blackboxsw: no, that's weird. I know they completely reset everything over there though.

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` hrm maybe they tracked irc nicks that were advertizing moving to Libera.chat is the only thing I can think. will check it out

 17:33 `<falcojr>` at this point probably just best to cut ties completely

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` yes agreed

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` community-notice: reminder rename upstream/master ->` upstream/main in 2 days.  All active PRs will automatically be retargetted. For your local clones for cloud-init it should mean only the following:
