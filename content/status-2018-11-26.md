 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` Morning/Afternoon folks. welcome to another cloud-init status meeting

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` ... our open forum to advertise current cloud-init developments, giving an opportunity to discuss bugs or features in cloud-init and provide a touch point for the community

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` Generally we go through the following topics: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, and Office hours

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` rharper: had closed out feedback on the review. with a needs fixing. I did see some followup commits there from the author Jason Zion.

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` I think we need to take a look at this again and see if our comments were addressed, I'm marking it "Needs review"

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` I see no other actions carried over... but there was talk last week about a couple of branches so let's add these

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` ([LP: \#1803598]([https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1803598](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1803598)))

 16:30 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1803598 in cloud-init "Do not retry polling IMDS for reprovisiondata during timeout" [Undecided,Fix committed]

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` t'was a slow week with all that Thanksgiving holiday stuff for US-based employees

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` welcome back from the Holidays boys and girls

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` also we were able to publish tip of cloud-init to Ubuntu Disco series

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` cloud-init 18.4-24-g8f812a15-0ubuntu1  has latest and greatest as seen on tip of master

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic  In-Progress Development

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` Our trello board tracks our queued and current work for cloud-init, feel free to watch that board for updates on significant cloud-init features/bug-fixes

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` what generally isn't tracked there is reviews on community authored branches

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` per community driven content, we have a number of branches from meena for better FreeBSD support in flight. Great work! and some Azure platform development to react to netlink events during the preprovisioning state.

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` thanks tamilmani_  on the azure work.

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` As a heads up to folks, we are trying to cut an upstream release of cloud-init 18.5  on 12/15/2018. So if there are branches you want to see landed  or bugs you need fixed please holler here in this channel or on the mailing list to:cloud-init.lists.launchpad.net

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` We'll send an email to the mailing list requesting for input on the release as well

 16:39 `<meena>` >` blackboxsw what generally isn't tracked there is reviews on community authored branches `<==  i did check there first time around, but found nothing that was topical for me

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` Correct meena . I used to capture outstanding community reviews that needed review follow up, but that ended up being out of date all the time. It was easier for us to just use launchpad active review queue instead

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` Now we've tried to adopt the setting of a branch status to 'work in progress' if we are expecting feedback/fixes from the author. And have the author set it back to 'needs review' when it is ready for another round of upstream reviews

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` having trello cards was basically just duplicating what launchpad reviews were designed for, we just need to be more vigilant about grooming the review queue and getting folks the feedback they need

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` might as well switch over to office hours for open discussion etc.

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 minutes)

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` Cloud-init upstream folks will have eyes on this channel for any discussions. requests, bugs or features folks want to discuss.

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` we'll also spend some time actively grooming the branch review queue to see if we can clear out some review debyt

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` we'll also spend some time actively grooming the branch review queue to see if we can clear out some review debt

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` I think smoser mentioned at our team standup this morning he was taking one more review on [https://code.launchpad.net/~tamilmani1989/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/336392](https://code.launchpad.net/~tamilmani1989/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/336392)

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` rharper: if you are done with your review on that tamilmani_ branch  can you add a comment that doesn't leave it in "Needs fixing" review state from yoiu?

 16:48 `<rharper>` blackboxsw: yes, I'm adding a commit message now, and I'll leave a comment marking approve;

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` excellent.

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` I'm going to give a review to [https://code.launchpad.net/~i.galic/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358876](https://code.launchpad.net/~i.galic/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358876)   now

 16:48 * blackboxsw claims a review slot

 16:49 `<rharper>` blackboxsw: did we have a LP for thisone ?

 16:49 `<rharper>` the netlink ?

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` ohh, no we did not I don't think.

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` I'll check

 16:56 `<meena>` blackboxsw: i think my (our) patch is ready to be merged

 16:57 `<blackboxsw>` rharper: yeah didn't find any bug filed related to Azure and dhcp leak or netlink response etc.

 16:57 `<meena>` (the feature / fix of adding connectivity check to ephemeral network stuff)

 16:58 `<blackboxsw>` meena: I think so too. Was just dusting off my memory on that one. I'm going to do a quick test run of setup/teardown and I think that's good. +1

 16:58 `<blackboxsw>` thanks again

 16:58 `<meena>` once that's merged, I'll have a much easier time with splitting out the freebsd network

 16:59 `<meena>` blackboxsw: thank you for showing me how to do the tests properly

 16:59 `<blackboxsw>` most welcome.

 17:00 `<rharper>` blackboxsw: thanks, me neither;  I just didn't want to miss a LP: in the commit message if we had one

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` after this branch lands and tamilmani_'s I probably will go through the motions of us publishing  to Ubuntu Disco again, because I want to get a round or two of integration tests on both Azure and AWS with both the ephemeral* changes and the netlink stuff on pristine cloud-images before next week's release

 17:06 `<blackboxsw>` meena: you didn't file a bug related to the ephermeraldhcp network connectivity did you? (I'm just double checking as I don't see one)

 17:07 `<blackboxsw>` meena: not needed, just didn't want to miss it if it was there (as we'd want to link it in the commit message)

 17:08 `<meena>` blackboxsw: nah, we just "filed" a mailing list thread

 17:08 `<blackboxsw>` all good thanks

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` ok I had filed [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1802598](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1802598)  but we won't tie that to this branch

 17:09 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1802598 in cloud-init "EphemeralIPv4Network: when device has requested existing network config, but link is down, network setup does not bring link up" [Undecided,Triaged]

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` it's a bit more about idempotent behavior

 17:13 `<meena>` *nod *nod

 17:13 `<meena>` i didn't think i had fixed it, so i didn't connect them.

 17:16 `<blackboxsw>` +1 on your branch meena, it should land within the hour. Just tested it out one more time

 17:16 `<meena>` cool

 17:16 `<blackboxsw>` ok I think that about wraps today's meeting timewise. Thanks again for the chat meena.

 17:16 `<meena>` \o/

 17:17 `<blackboxsw>` next meeting is Dec 10, 2018 sameish time

 17:17 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
