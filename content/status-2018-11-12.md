 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting Cloud-init bi-weekly status

 16:17 `<meetingology>` Meeting started Mon Nov 12 16:17:50 2018 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw. Information about MeetBot at [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.)

 16:17 `<meetingology>` 

 16:17 `<meetingology>` Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` Morning/afternoon folks. Time for another brief episode of cloud-init upstream updates

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` Last meeting was 10/29 and meeting minutes live over on github

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/](https://cloud-init.github.io/)

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` This meeting is an open forum for cloud-init discussions and status updates, feel free to interject at any time. It really is just a venue by which we can make sure we all have eyes and ears available for discussion on features, bugs or branches if needed.

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` Generally we go through the following topics: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development,  and Office hours

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#toic Previous Actions

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` So last meeting we carried in one action, to review the following Azure branch related to DHCP and RHEL race conditions

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` [https://code.launchpad.net/~jasonzio/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/357427](https://code.launchpad.net/~jasonzio/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/357427)

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` Looks like rharper got a review in and I don't see any updates from Jason Zion (author) in response to that branch

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` thanks rharper

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` I'm marking that branch as 'Work in progress' and commenting that the author should set it back to 'Needs review' when comments have been addressed

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` ok done. No further actions seen

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:24 * blackboxsw digs up changes since 10/28

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` sorry interrupted.

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` Here are the changes committed:

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` - azure: add udev rules to create cloud-init Gen2 disk name symlinks

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` ([LP: \#1797480]([https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1797480](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1797480)))

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` - tests: ec2 mock missing httpretty user-data and instance-identity routes

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` - azure: remove /etc/netplan/90-hotplug-azure.yaml when net from IMDS

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` - azure: report ready to fabric after reprovision and reduce logging

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` [asakkurr] ([LP: \#1799594]([https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1799594](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1799594)))

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` - query: better error when missing read permission on instance-data

 16:29 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1797480 in cloud-init "Azure: Support ephemeral disk handling on Gen2 VMs" [High,Fix committed]

 16:29 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1799594 in cloud-init "Azure - Report ready during preprovisioning as soon as we get the ReprovisionData" [Undecided,Fix committed]

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` As you can see we are seeing a bit of momentum on azure datasource and some continuous integration cleanup on our side.

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks asakkurr for pulling that Azure branch together

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` We track our current cloud-init development publicly on trello

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` if there are any questions about certain branches or work feel free to comment in channel or on the linked branches we document there.

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` It looks like the Ubuntu archive for Disco Dingo series is open, so we'll likely be pushing an upload of tip of cloud-init by EOD today to get a new release queued

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` Also to note, I'd like to see us land [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358112](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358112)  to fix an Azure retry on IMDS timeout to avoid cloud-init giving up if the instance boots while IMDS service is down or temporarily unavailable (I've only seen this once on any azure instance)

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358112](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358112)

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` we also have a fairly deep review queue, so we'll be attacking that in the 2nd half of today's meeting to clear out and respond to some of those merge proposals

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` I also think we have some mailing list threads to start responding to per usage of EphemeralDHCPv4 and EphemeralIPv4Network context managers.

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` I *think* the intent there should be that those context managers ensure that they setup whatever requested network configuration is misssing from a network interface.... so if an interface is 'down'  yet has correct address configured, ephemeral* will make sure it is in operable 'up' state .

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` See the following bug for more information:

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1802598](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1802598)

 16:38 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1802598 in cloud-init "EphemeralIPv4Network: when device has requested existing network config, but link is down, network setup does not bring link up" [Undecided,New]

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` I believe that about wraps it for current in-flight work. I'll drop us into office hours at the point

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 minutes)

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` Cloud-init upstream folks will have eyes on this channel for any discussions. requests, bugs or features folks want to discuss.

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` I'll spend most of this time on reviews to start to clear our review queue (or at least get some responses out to folks for more information)(

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` ok looks like [https://code.launchpad.net/~jasonzio/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/357669](https://code.launchpad.net/~jasonzio/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/357669) is ready for landing. Just kicking off a CI test run on it

 17:04 `<blackboxsw>` also the approved version of this branch didn't actually match what Jenkins autolander expected, I've kick the jenkins landing job that should truly land that branch now. [https://code.launchpad.net/~asakkurr/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358422](https://code.launchpad.net/~asakkurr/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358422)'

 17:25 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~i.galic/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/357723](https://code.launchpad.net/~i.galic/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/357723)

 17:25 `<blackboxsw>` ok just got through an initial review there too.

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` ok looks like our lander merged [https://code.launchpad.net/~asakkurr/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358422](https://code.launchpad.net/~asakkurr/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/358422)

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` and :( [https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/job/cloud-init-ci/431/console](https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/job/cloud-init-ci/431/console) the CI on jason zion

 17:27 `<blackboxsw>` and :( [https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/job/cloud-init-ci/431/console](https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/job/cloud-init-ci/431/console) the CI on jason zion's branch will take 9 hrs and 51 minutes (because it doesn't have our CI fix for leaked test_ec2 link local unittests which take forever to timeout

 17:27 `<blackboxsw>` ok will that about wraps today's status meeting

 17:27 `<blackboxsw>` thanks all

 17:27 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
