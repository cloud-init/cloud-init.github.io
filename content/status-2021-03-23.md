 17:22 `<blackboxsw>` \0 woot thanks Odd_Bloke

 17:23 `<Odd_Bloke>` Hey folks, the cloud-init committers will be around for the next while, to answer any questions or have any discussions you're interested in having.

 17:23 `<Odd_Bloke>` blackboxsw posted a status update to Discourse earlier today.

 17:23 `<blackboxsw>` Here's the discourse post for reference on recent cloud-init events

 17:23 `<blackboxsw>` thanks Odd_Bloke

 17:23 `<Odd_Bloke>` Haha

 17:23 `<Odd_Bloke>` Please read it twice.

 17:24 `<blackboxsw>` and correct any clerical errors

 17:25 `<blackboxsw>` one topic of interested that hamalq  brought up yesterday was the "feature" of RedHat and CentOS that automatically prefers fqdn  over hostname in \#cloud-config per this bug

 17:25 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1724414](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1724414)

 17:25 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1724414 in cloud-init "rhel distro selects FQDN as hostname" [Low,Won't fix]

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` I mentioned we'd bring it up to reflect our opinion on this behavior today after a discussion

 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` I think the upstream stance on RedHat and CentOS is that this default behavior on RedHat/CentOS has been in play for a long time and changing that default behavior would be asking to cause problems for the majority of users who may rely on this behavior during system launch.

 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: falcojr did we say in this case we'd prefer a new bug which better describes the desired use-case and how current cloud-init doesn't allow for that use-case?

 17:30 `<blackboxsw>` that's all the content/discussion I had. I know I needed to get otubo a review today on his resize lvm partition branch [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/721](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/721) as my stale review was blocking that.

 17:31 `<Odd_Bloke>` We've closed out that bug as Won't Fix; we'd like folks who consider themselves affected by that bug to file a new one which describes their specific problem with the current situation: we can then work to support those requirements.

 18:24 `<Odd_Bloke>` OK, sounds like there's not much to chat about; thanks to any lurkers. :)
