 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` Below is a list of commits that have landed in tip of master: found via git log --since 2020-03-10

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/YMb2Tw3tRD/](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/YMb2Tw3tRD/)

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` We've had a number of milestones since the last status meeting, Ubuntu Focal Fossa 20.04 was released on Apr 23, cloud-init upstream cut a release 20.2 as well

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` Additionally we have two new hires to the canonical ubuntu-server team that will be participating in cloud-init, curtin and ubuntu-advantage-tools projects

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` We are really excited to have some extra hands on cloud-init from lucasmoura and falcojr. So welcome gentlemen, glad to have the help.

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` They just started yesterday and are going through a bit of onboarding this week, but expect to see them around in cloud-init shortly. I believe they have both landed their first PRs to get added as a contributor to cloud-init.

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls)

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` ok active review queue is really getting well maintained now that we've adopted PR assignment. Thanks for helping is land branches quickly folks.

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` Generally upstream has set a couple of long-term goals for cloud-init in the next development cycle

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` - wrap up cloud-init daemon mode (to reduce boot time by loading python only once)

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` - OpenStack network hotplug handling from cloud-init

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` - Potentially a new LXD datasource for handling container deployments

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` - better json schema coverage for the remaining oncovered cloud config modules.

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` We continue to categorize more bitesize bugs in cloud-init.

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` \#link  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs)?field.tag=bitesize

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` These bugs are themed at doc updates and json schema improvements across all of cloud-init, but we continue to seed that bug tag with items which should be easy to drop in and make a lasting impact on cloud-init

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` All cloud-init contributors are encouraged to participate in any part of the cloud-init lifecycle, from bug filing, to fixing, to release testing and PR reviews. Thanks to everyone who continues to build the cloud-init community!

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` During this stage we have a some focus time on cloud-init development and community support. Any questions, concerns, reviews or request for help/triage are most welcome. We should have a couple of upstream developers with eyes on this channel.

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` In the absence of discussion, we'll groom the active PR review queue and/or work additional cloud-init dev items.

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` community-notice: Ubuntu plans  to release cloud-init version 20.2 to Ubuntu's new development release 20.10 (Groovy Gorilla). We expect to start an Ubuntu StableReleaseUpdate into xenial, bionic, eoan and  focal within the next 2 weeks.

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` alrighty, think that about wraps today's status meeting. Happy Cinco De Mayo folks

 17:34 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
