 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting cloud-init bi-weekly office-hours

 16:32 `<meetingology>` Meeting started at 16:32:21 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw.  Information about MeetBot at [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology)

 16:32 `<meetingology>` Available commands: action, commands, idea, info, link, nick

 16:32 `<paride>` smoser, thanks, merged!

 16:33 `<paride>` but as it's not in the server packageset I'll need sponsorship for the upload...

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` community-notice: Let's get back to a more regularly scheduled cloud-init office hours. Every two weeks, feel free to watch the channel topic for the next scheduled time. We'll ensure to have a couple of sets of eyes on this IRC  channel.

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` Next office-hours meeting is set for June 1, 17:15 UTC. It is worth us having this recurring meeting to give anyone a chance to drive-by \#cloud-init if they have questions, discussions, bugs or PRs that need attention.

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` Prior to the office hours, we will continue to generate a post with the latest commits to land in cloud-init:master as well as any notable features in progress [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cloud-init-status-05-18-2021/22349](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cloud-init-status-05-18-2021/22349)

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` From upstream standpoint,  we were able to cut the time-based release 21.2 on May 6th. And for Ubuntu, we have queued the StableReleaseUpdate (SRU) for 21.2 into Bionic, Focal and Hirsute for which falcojr and Odd_Bloke have been going through verification.

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` Think we need to update the topic for the 21.2 upstream release too.

 16:42 `<smoser>` paride: [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/y3N7wjCG3n/](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/y3N7wjCG3n/)

 16:44 `<smoser>` fudge.

 16:44 `<smoser>` but i just noticed your changelog didn't have LP: \#1908452

 16:44 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1908452 in MAAS "MAAS stops working and deployment fails after `Loading ephemeral` step" [High,In progress] [https://launchpad.net/bugs/1908452](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1908452)

 16:45 `<smoser>` because the commit message said 'Fixes LP:1908452' rather than just 'LP: \#1908452'

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` 'Fixes LP:1908452'  almost github; almost LP :/

 16:48 `<paride>` smoser, argh :/ will update the bug status manually

 16:48 `<paride>` thanks for the upload

 16:50 * blackboxsw falcojr: do we have a trello board for the SRU 21.2 created?

 16:50 `<falcojr>` yep, [https://trello.com/b/tBP3Jrwp/sru-cloud-init-212](https://trello.com/b/tBP3Jrwp/sru-cloud-init-212) (just made it public)

 16:51 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks a lot

 16:55 `<blackboxsw>` Great, I was originally looking at the older trello board for the 21.1. Ok, so I'll grab Softlayer testing as you mentioned at standup today. If you want me to run through other clouds just let me know or hit me up for reviews.

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` Alright, I think that about wraps today's office hours. Next round in two weeks. Thanks for tuning in.

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
