 17:17 `<meetingology>` 

 17:17 `<meetingology>` Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 17:18 `<blackboxsw>` Welcome folks to another cloud-init status meeting. Probably the last one of the year I presume due to upcoming Holidays in two weeks

 17:18 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair rharper

 17:18 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: blackboxsw rharper

 17:18 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair Odd_Bloke

 17:18 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: Odd_Bloke blackboxsw rharper

 17:18 `<rharper>` o/

 17:18 `<blackboxsw>` cloud-init upstream uses this meeting as a platform for community updates, feature/bug discussions, and an opportunity to get some extra input on current development.

 17:19 `<blackboxsw>` Let's start the meeting with setting the next meeting time

 17:19 `<blackboxsw>` day/time

 17:20 `<blackboxsw>` I think most of upstream is out the last two weeks of December. Shall we try January 7th?

 17:20 `<blackboxsw>` Anyone opposed can voice their discontent as I remember the keystrokes to set the topic of the channel ;)_

 17:21 `<blackboxsw>` I also dropped 19.3 upstream release date from the channel topic as "that's soooo November"

 17:22 `<blackboxsw>` topics for this round: Feel free to interject/suggest other topics at any time.  Our typical format is the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Community Charter, Upcoming Meetings, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 17:31 `<blackboxsw>` thanks for all the FreeBSD work landing, utility improvements, caching and doc changes. + the dhcp lease format updates

 17:31 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` Generally upstream is doing a fair job of getting reviews to the community for PRs, though lately we've been spending a few cycles on SRU validation for cloud-init 19.4.31 into Ubuntu Xenial, Bionic, Disco and Eoan.

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` expectation is that we should be able to clear this SRU validation today/tomorrow and get back onto the review queue in github for cloud-init

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` most major cloud-platforms have passed validation with no regressions, so risk is low with this release

 17:34 `<blackboxsw>` oops cloud-init 19.3.41  not 19.4.31

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` there is plenty of work in flight by meena (FreeBSD improvements) and ahosmanMSFT (Azure instance-id work). that we hope to get reviewed and landed.

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` community notice: Reminder we are working toward a 19.4 upstream release by end of year. So if there are bits/features that you hope to make the cut. please get those branches in shape by next tuesday Decemeber 17th

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00236.html](https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00236.html)

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` community notice: Also a reminder that cloud-inig 19.4 will be the last release that claims official support for py2.7

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` in January, tip of cloud-init will be allowed to drift from python2.7 support and tox -e py27 will no longer be exercised by upstream CI

 17:38 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: or rharper anyything else in-progress at the moment?

 17:39 `<blackboxsw>` also, anyone interested in cloud-init development, please run tools/migrate-lp-user-to-github as mentioned in the hacking guide to make sure we can account for the CLA (contributor license agreement) for cloud-init

 17:39 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/hacking.html](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/hacking.html)

 17:40 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 17:40 `<blackboxsw>` reminder on 19.4 release covered above, and getting your github account authorized for cloud-init conributions....

 17:41 `<Odd_Bloke>` Nothing from me!

 17:41 `<meena>` goneri and i have been working on / testing his freebsd render

 17:42 `<blackboxsw>` for folks with time to burn and bite-sized branches/fixes. we've got a lane on our trello board that gives a variety of fixes that the community can grab if they are looking for quick suggestions. "Community low-hanging fruit"

 17:42 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 17:42 `<blackboxsw>` meena: Goneri yes and thanks for the continued efforts there. A lot of good is coming out for cloud-init upstream as a result.

 17:42 `<meena>` Goneri removed a lot of code, but from what i gather, that code is still used elsewhere

 17:43 `<meena>` could someone explain why our where our how

 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` as always, any community member is encouraged to review other PRs from devs. All reviews and input welcome.

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` meena: I'm not sure I follow, are you referring to a specific branch?

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` or just where stale snapshots or cloud-init code lives on certain distros?

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` might as well kick the topic and open office hours for general cloud-init discussions, questions, bug/feature work etc.

 17:46 `<blackboxsw>` some upstream devs will have eyes/time available for discussion around anything cloud-init. This time will also be spent grooming the active review queue @ [https://git.io/JeVed](https://git.io/JeVed)

 17:46 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://git.io/JeVed](https://git.io/JeVed)

 17:48 `<meena>` blackboxsw: [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/61\#pullrequestreview-329139891](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/61\#pullrequestreview-329139891)

 17:48 `<blackboxsw>` checking

 17:52 `<blackboxsw>` meena: so Distro._bring_up_interface() is called by Distro._bring_up_interfaces() base class via Distro.apply_network

 17:59 `<blackboxsw>` which is called from Init.apply_network_config which gets run during "cloud-init init"  when network is brought up

 18:06 `<blackboxsw>` I think [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/42](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/42) looks ready to merge. rharper has an outstanding "changes requested" but I believe those have been fixed. rharper I'll defer to you on this one

 18:08 `<blackboxsw>` and policy question on reviews: if we get one upstream core-dev +1 can we proceed to land the branch as long as the "changes requested" from other upstream core seem to be resolved?

 18:09 `<blackboxsw>` I'd vote that most recent core-dev on the PR that +1's can squash merge if they see that any prior core-dev's concerns seem to be addressed

 18:12 `<blackboxsw>` I think I'll add an action for next meeting to make sure we iron out review/merge policy so PRs don't sit stale

 18:13 `<blackboxsw>` \#action rharper confirm no concerns on [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/42](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/42) and that PR can land.

 18:13 * meetingology rharper confirm no concerns on [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/42](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/42) and that PR can land.

 18:14 `<blackboxsw>` \#action upstream core-devs to decide about whether a PR can land if any upstream dev still has 'requested changes'

 18:14 * meetingology upstream core-devs to decide about whether a PR can land if any upstream dev still has 'requested changes'

 18:16 `<blackboxsw>` ok I *think* that about wraps the meeting. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy New Year and all that good stuff. See you all online.

 18:16 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
