 16:15 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: Odd_Bloke rharper

 16:15 `<rharper>` hi folks, welcome to another cloud-init community status meeting. All discussions and interjections welcome.

 16:16 `<rharper>` cloud-init upstream uses this meeting as a platform for community updates, feature/bug discussions, and an opportunity to get some extra input on current development.

 16:16 `<rharper>` our format is the following topics: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Office Hours

 16:16 `<rharper>` anyone is welcome to participate, interject, make suggestions or ask questions

 16:16 `<rharper>` we host the meeting every two weeks at the date and time  indicated in the IRC channel topic  ^

 16:17 `<rharper>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:17 `<Odd_Bloke>` o/

 16:17 `<rharper>` We had a few previous action items to look at

 16:18 `<rharper>` [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1832381](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1832381)

 16:18 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1832381 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "vm fails to boot due to conflicting network configuration when user switches from netplan to eni" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 16:18 `<rharper>` AnhVoMSFT was looking to collect logs from this scenario;

 16:19 `<Goneri>` hey!

 16:19 `<rharper>` it appears that getting an instance where the MAC address changes is harder so fewer folks trip over this; however, we agreed that cloud-init can track which renderer it used and if it switches it can clean up the config it wrote;

 16:19 `<rharper>` \#action rharper to update [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1832381](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1832381) status

 16:19 * meetingology rharper to update [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1832381](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1832381) status

 16:19 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1832381 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "vm fails to boot due to conflicting network configuration when user switches from netplan to eni" [Undecided,Incomplete]

 16:20 `<rharper>` The other action was to review [https://code.launchpad.net/~vtqanh/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/369785](https://code.launchpad.net/~vtqanh/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/369785)

 16:20 `<rharper>` This was completed the other week while we worked toward the 19.2 release; that branch is currently work-in-progress, awaiting feedback/changes from submitter

 16:21 `<rharper>` that's all of the action items from previous meeting

 16:22 `<rharper>` previous meeting status found here:

 16:26 `<rharper>` \#link [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cloud-init-19-2-release/11873](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/cloud-init-19-2-release/11873)

 16:26 `<rharper>` a big thank you from the cloud-init team to everyone who helped contribute to the release

 16:27 `<Goneri>` do you have time for a little BSD update?

 16:27 `<rharper>` Yes, let's talk about In progress developement

 16:27 `<rharper>` \#topic In Progress Development

 16:27 `<rharper>` Goneri: go ahead

 16:28 `<Goneri>` \#topic FreeBSD/NetBSD status

 16:28 `<Goneri>` so there is two active branches, the first one is: [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368507](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368507)

 16:28 `<rharper>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368507](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368507)

 16:29 `<Goneri>` it has started with a tiny fix to address a configuration difference with FreeBSD (there is no chpasswd there)

 16:29 `<Goneri>` and it's now a slightly bigger refactoring now, I believe it clarify the code base and I would like to land it like that.

 16:30 `<Goneri>` a discussion is ongoing with rharper on the PR

 16:30 `<Goneri>` second PR is [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/365641](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/365641)

 16:30 `<Goneri>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/365641](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/365641)

 16:30 `<Goneri>` this one is much bigger, and I've just addressed the last comment from rharper, I test it often and it works fine for me

 16:31 `<Goneri>` if you want to give it a try, I pushed some pre-built images here: [http://bsd-cloud-image.org/](http://bsd-cloud-image.org/)

 16:31 `<rharper>` nice!

 16:31 `<Goneri>` I test it with OpenStack and NoCloud, a friend who maintains CBSD also test it on Bhyve (FreeBSD)

 16:32 `<Goneri>` finally, the last one is [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368508](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368508)

 16:32 `<Goneri>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368508](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368508)

 16:32 `<Goneri>` No active merge request yet because it depends on the two actives PR that I just mentioned

 16:32 `<Goneri>` this patch brings NetBSD support (7 and 8)

 16:33 `<Goneri>` I would like to work on OpenBSD later, but it's still a low priority

 16:34 `<rharper>` Goneri: thanks for the update

 16:34 `<Goneri>` finally, I've a bunch of scripts that I use to build my images

 16:35 `<Goneri>` it's still rather raw, but I would like to integrate that at some point with your CI

 16:35 `<Goneri>` that's all

 16:35 `<rharper>` thanks

 16:36 `<rharper>` \#topic In Progress Development

 16:36 `<rharper>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~tribaal/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/369516](https://code.launchpad.net/~tribaal/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/369516)

 16:36 `<rharper>` Adding a new datasource for Exoscale

 16:36 `<rharper>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~xiaofengw/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/367889](https://code.launchpad.net/~xiaofengw/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/367889)

 16:36 `<rharper>` vmware user-defined-scripts

 16:37 `<rharper>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~daniel-thewatkins/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/369783](https://code.launchpad.net/~daniel-thewatkins/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/369783)

 16:37 `<rharper>` Allow datasources to configure the order of network-config sources

 16:37 `<rharper>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/feature/stage_threadpool](https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/feature/stage_threadpool)

 16:38 `<Odd_Bloke>` I'm expecting to have a response to Ryan's review comments on that today, and whatever conclusion we reach shouldn't be too much work to implement.

 16:38 `<rharper>` definitely

 16:38 `<Odd_Bloke>` And then I'll have a follow-up to split apart the "cmdline" network data source in to "cmdline" and "initramfs", which are currently conflated.

 16:39 `<Odd_Bloke>` (Neither of these should cause behavioural changes, they're just setting us up for some data source work down the line.)

 16:40 `<rharper>` The threadpool branch is a more general approach to handle running modules async from the mainthread;  there were some limitations depending on systemd;  and there is a desire for more than just disk_setup to run async;  this branch I'm working on would allow modules to be tagged async and they run in a separate thread allowing the next module to proceed; we then join at the end of stage to ensure completion of threads;

 16:41 `<rharper>` any other upstream development I'm missing?

 16:43 `<rharper>` ok, I think that's it then;

 16:43 `<rharper>` \#topic  Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:43 `<rharper>` feel free to ask for help, reviews, discussions on any cloud-init items you're looking at.

 16:44 `<metsuke>` Is Ubuntu the recommended, or most maintained, distribution of cloud-init?

 16:46 `<rharper>` metsuke: hi; cloud-init in Ubuntu is the most-up-to-date as we're both the upstream maintainers (working for Canonical) and handle getting the latest upstream into Ubuntu images

 16:47 `<rharper>` metsuke: we also help produce daily rpm builds for RedHat/Centos/Fedora in our copr repo

 16:47 `<rharper>` \#link [https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/cloud-init-dev/](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/cloud-init-dev/)

 16:48 `<rharper>` \#link [https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/Tools/](https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/Tools/)

 16:48 `<rharper>` suse's cloud:Tools keeps a really recent cloud-init as well

 16:48 `<metsuke>` great, thanks for the info!

 16:48 `<rharper>` sure

 16:49 `<metsuke>` I'm looking to distribute standardized VMs to 100+ sites running ESXi so I'm trying to find the best way to do that =)

 16:52 `<Odd_Bloke>` metsuke: If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask in here; we're generally around US working hours, for reference.

 16:53 `<rharper>` yes, cloud-init can help keep your base image generic, allowing customization to happen at boot time;

 16:53 `<metsuke>` thanks, I'm trying to do some preliminary investigation so I have an intelligent question to ask =P
