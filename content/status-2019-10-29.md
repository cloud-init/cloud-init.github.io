 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting Cloud-init bi-weekly status

 16:20 `<meetingology>` Meeting started Tue Oct 29 16:20:09 2019 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw. Information about MeetBot at [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.)

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` Boo! Welcome to the Halloween edition of cloud-init bi-weekly status meeting

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair rharper

 16:20 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: blackboxsw rharper

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair Odd_Bloke

 16:20 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: Odd_Bloke blackboxsw rharper

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` cloud-init upstream uses this meeting as a platform for community updates, feature/bug discussions, and an opportunity to get some extra input on current development.

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` shamefully I think we wall missed last week's status. So let's celebrate today instead to catch up with where cloud-init development is headed

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` So that we don't forget, let's set the topic for next status meeting.

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: rharper does 11/12 look good?

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` as in, no holidays etc?

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` ok topic updated. Any concerns we can change it and send out an email to the mailing list

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` Feel free to interject at any time. Our typical format is the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Community Charter, Upcoming Meetings, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` I have three actions from last meeting

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2019-10-08.html\#status-2019-10-08](https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2019-10-08.html\#status-2019-10-08)

 16:28 * blackboxsw blackboxsw verify cpc image builds are unpaused/unblocked for Azure   (we were able to confirm the the CPC clound image builds for Azure were on time for the two cloud-init SRUs and worked that communication side-channel with Microsoft.

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` We also established a point of contact via email for continued cloud image status updates

 16:29 * blackboxsw cloud-init upstream review [https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957](https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957)  .   This branch is getting a bit of review work. It's looking pretty good and I expect we'll land it this week or next (Azure continuous integration testing support) Thanks ahosmanMSFT

 16:30 `<chillysurfer>` nice, good work ahosmanMSFT

 16:30 * blackboxsw upstream cloud-init email about 19.3 release date .   rharper just sent out a message to announce the 19.3 upstream release date. on 11/05. [https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00229.html](https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00229.html)

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00229.html](https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00229.html)

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` thx chillysurfer :)

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` anyone with vested interested in getting branches into the 19.3 upstream release please ping us in this channel or the mailinglist to get branches reviewed and landed by Tuesday of next week

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` As a note, we are planning a 19.4 release by end of year too, so ~6 weeks later we can get branches into 19.4 that miss the 19.3 release date

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` and for those that aren't aware cloud-init's upstream releases generally are not feature-based but time based. Our goal is 4 time-based releases per year having the versioning schema `<YEAR>`.`<minor_release_number>`   where minor_release_number will be [1-4]

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` if there are significant features that are near completion at a given timed release we will try our best to get those features/fixes vetted and landed.

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` shortly after each upstream release, we will publish that cloud-init version to the Ubuntu devel release (codenamed named Focal Fossa) our copr repos and SRU into Xenial, Bionic and Eoan.

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` ok long-winded. But I think that was our actions from last cloud-init status meeting.

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` next topic

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` some good incremental improvements on SuSE, FreeBSD,Ubuntu Azure, Ec2, OpenStack and Exoscale

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks Dominic, Robert, XiaoFeng, Harald and Darren and Scott for the contibutions this round!

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` We keep track of most of cloud-init's development efforts on the cloud-init and curtin trello board above.

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` And the active review queue for cloud-init is a good representation of what should land shortly.

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [http://bit.ly/ci-reviews](http://bit.ly/ci-reviews)

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` The following work-streams are currently in progress:

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` - CI for Azure (thanks ahosmanMSFT)

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` - Openstack networking v2 support (which allows openstack to talk v2 network config 'netplan' )

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` - Azure async disk mounts

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` - cloud-init boot performance improvements

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` As features related to those streams make progress we'll be updating the trello board and dragging cards to the done lane

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` There are also a number of branches for  FreeBSD support up that we need to shepherd and merge I think

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368507](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368507)

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` We'll be able to review some of the outstanding branches during Office hours today

 16:49 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` This point in the meeting is essentially an open reminder of the ongoing community charter work and low hanging fruit that everyone is invited to participate in.

 16:51 `<blackboxsw>` We has a list of tasks/features and bugs that are considered low-hanging-fruit  and highly decoupled work items that anyone is welcome to grab. They are listed in the "Community low hanging fruit" column on our trello board

 16:51 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` Our current community goal is to scrub, update  and correct all datasource docs seen @ [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources.html](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources.html)

 16:52 `<tribaal>` That's nice!

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` all help is appreciated especially from the datasource owners

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` \o tribaal.

 16:52 `<tribaal>` o/

 16:53 `<tribaal>` sorry, I'm following along, didn't mean to interrupt

 16:53 `<blackboxsw>` additionally there is a really long tail of work needed to update each cloud-init config module (cloudinit/config/cc_*py) with a json schema definition.

 16:55 `<blackboxsw>` There are around 50 modules that would need a jsonschema definition so that we can promote our `cloud-init devel schema` command to it can properly vet any \#cloud-config a user provides to annotate user errors

 16:55 `<blackboxsw>` any help grabbing individualy config modules and adding that would really add value to cloud-init to help users solve their own errors as invalid \#cloud-config is one of our highest frequency issues

 16:56 `<blackboxsw>` example [https://trello.com/c/NENad4m3/1172-schema-add-initial-schema-definition-for-ccpowerstatechange](https://trello.com/c/NENad4m3/1172-schema-add-initial-schema-definition-for-ccpowerstatechange)

 16:56 `<blackboxsw>` no worries, interruptions welcome

 16:56 `<blackboxsw>` think that about wraps up community charter.

 16:56 `<blackboxsw>` two to topics to go

 16:57 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Upcoming meetings

 16:57 `<blackboxsw>` I already updated the topic. 2 weeks from today 11/05 10:15 utc cloud-init status. We'll be here; feel free to drop in

 16:58 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Upcoming Releases

 16:59 `<blackboxsw>` Again cloud-init upstream 19.3 scheduled to be cut next Tuesday 11/05 at EOD. Raise awareness in \#cloud-init IRC channel or on the mailing list for bugs and feature branches that need attention prior to cutting the release

 16:59 `<blackboxsw>` Immediately after release, we'll publish to  Ubuntu's devel release Focal Fossa  and our copr repo

 16:59 `<tribaal>` nice! this answers one of the questions I had coming in today :)

 16:59 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/el-testing/](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/el-testing/)

 16:59 `<blackboxsw>` good deal tribaal

 17:00 `<blackboxsw>` and again, upstream will schedulae 19.4 release probably ~6 weeks after 19.3 so not long to wait if folks miss 19.3

 17:00 `<blackboxsw>` *schedule* even

 17:00 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` bring your bugs, discussions, features, concerns here about cloud-init life the universe and everything. upstream will spend this time actively grooming the review queue to see if we can't unblock developers

 17:02 `<tribaal>` blackboxsw: I suspect the plan for y'all is to SRU 19.3 into the various Ubuntues after it lands in focal?

 17:03 `<tribaal>` my latest bugfix, although small, impacts one of our customers so I'd like to give them a heads up in that direction

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` tribaal: yep sorry, I mentioned earlier, but should have mentioned in the last topic

 17:03 `<tribaal>` no worries

 17:03 `<tribaal>` it's the logical follow-up to a release - so it was surely implied

 17:04 `<blackboxsw>` SRU will be scheduled shortly after 19.3  upstream cut I presume.  We prefer to keep time between SRUs smaller to make the verification more manageable

 17:04 `<tribaal>` blackboxsw: do you know how/when cloud-init lands in other distros, as a matter of curiosity?

 17:04 `<blackboxsw>` I think now that Ubuntu Eoan is released and post-release dust is settling we'll have bandwidth to cover that

 17:05 `<blackboxsw>` tribaal: robjo knows for SLES. otubo (hrm not here today) is managing RHEL/CentOS release schedules

 17:06 `<blackboxsw>` and debian is trying to shore up to 19.X I believe.

 17:06 `<tribaal>` ack

 17:06 `<blackboxsw>` but I think other distros are delayed (for good reasons: testing/validation/stability/etc).

 17:07 `<tribaal>` sure, that would make sense

 17:07 `<tribaal>` more QA is good :)

 17:07 * blackboxsw finds myself wanting a current support matrix on cloudinit.readthedocs.io

 17:07 `<blackboxsw>` or somewhere

 17:07 `<tribaal>` that would be incredibly useful to us :)

 17:08 `<blackboxsw>` agreed. Maybe we can take an action to at least discuss what that would look like (and where to host it)

 17:08 `<tribaal>` tracking where and when our new datasource is available is a bit of a mystery right now :)

 17:08 `<tribaal>` (except for Ubuntus)

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` \#action cloud-init upstream discuss where/how/if to host documentation  supported cloud-init versions for debian/suse/redhat/ubuntu/freebsd etc.

 17:09 * meetingology cloud-init upstream discuss where/how/if to host documentation  supported cloud-init versions for debian/suse/redhat/ubuntu/freebsd etc.

 17:09 `<tribaal>` blackboxsw: another question since I have the mic: would it be useful to you to add us to your CI pipeline?

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` we can come back with some kindof answer for that question (as I end up doing more work like lxc launch distroX) frequently to try to see

 17:11 `<tribaal>` blackboxsw: cool - but that's more a measure rather than an expected date right? so it wouldn't help our marketing people to plan blog posts for instance (which is why I'm asking this in the first place - we have some comms ready to go around a feature that requires the new datasource)

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` tribaal: I think it would be useful to extend our cloudinit/tests/cloud_tests to allow us to manually kick off exoscale runs during SRU validation. Especially if you are finding that our upstream changes are breaking your platform

 17:12 `<blackboxsw>` tribaal: yeah let me restate the action then

 17:12 `<blackboxsw>` \#action cloud-init upstream discuss where/how/if to host documentation  on supported and planned schedule for cloud-init versions for debian/suse/redhat/ubuntu/freebsd etc.

 17:12 * meetingology cloud-init upstream discuss where/how/if to host documentation  on supported and planned schedule for cloud-init versions for debian/suse/redhat/ubuntu/freebsd etc.

 17:12 `<blackboxsw>` per scheduling we at least could start filling in some gaps there on cloud-init planned distro releases

 17:13 `<tribaal>` blackboxsw: so, you're basically never breaking our platform - clearly :) But being part of the SRU validation would be good maybe. I don't know how much work that is however (I don't know what I'm asking).

 17:13 `<tribaal>` is that something we can do ourselves?

 17:13 `<tribaal>` (code wise at least)

 17:14 `<blackboxsw>` tribaal: codewise, if you are talking about manual tests, we generally run something like the following:

 17:14 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/blob/master/manual/ec2-sru-19.2.36.ubuntu2.txt](https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/blob/master/manual/ec2-sru-19.2.36.ubuntu2.txt)

 17:15 `<blackboxsw>` if you wanted to write up an example manual  sru test and propose it to  [https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/](https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/)

 17:15 `<blackboxsw>` you could follow the examples in [https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/blob/master/manual/ec2-sru-19.2.36.ubuntu2.txt](https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/blob/master/manual/ec2-sru-19.2.36.ubuntu2.txt)

 17:15 `<blackboxsw>` oops wrong paste

 17:15 `<blackboxsw>` you could follow the examples in : [https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/tree/master/sru-templates/manual](https://github.com/cloud-init/ubuntu-sru/tree/master/sru-templates/manual)

 17:16 `<tribaal>` oh, I see

 17:16 `<tribaal>` so thankfully it's only manual in the "manually run a script" sense :)

 17:16 `<blackboxsw>` and create one for exoscale. that's lowest hanging fruit I think. that'd increase chances of including a manual test in the SRU process. but, we might have to ping you for a recommendation on who could run that on our behalf

 17:17 `<tribaal>` yes, that would work (myself, and a handful of colleagues would be happy to I guess)

 17:17 `<blackboxsw>` that's lowest hanging fruit. next step up would be to add a platform definition that can automatically drive Exoscale  like ahosmanMSFT has for Azure in progress at [https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957](https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957)

 17:18 `<blackboxsw>` having the cloud_tests platform definition would allow us our you to more easily extend a jenkins CI job to drive the cloud tests

 17:19 `<tribaal>` ah nice, that makes sense

 17:19 `<blackboxsw>` tribaal: the manual SRU verification script writing really helps (but is not mandatory) prior to extending tests/cloud_tests.  having a manual script helps codify what we really might need to do to fully support a platform in tests/cloud_tests.

 17:20 `<tribaal>` yeah that sounds like a good first step, and we can expand later on if/when needed

 17:24 `<blackboxsw>` +1 tribaal

 17:24 `<blackboxsw>` btw good deal that you were able to run into Odd_Bloke on your travels. Always good to see a familiar face

 17:24 `<tribaal>` yeah that was a crazy coincidence

 17:25 `<tribaal>` my brother got married in Odd_Bloke 's backyard :)

 17:25 `<tribaal>` I wish we could do cross-company colocated sprints :P

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` heh, I think we can call those \#cloud-init-summits :)

 17:26 `<tribaal>` ohhh yeah :)

 17:26 `<tribaal>` when's the next one?

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` we'll have to get invites together for the next one (Fall 2020)

 17:27 `<tribaal>` noted :)

 17:29 `<blackboxsw>` Ohh right and BIG NEWS that I forgot to highlight: cloud-init *is* moving from launchpad to github. We discussed this at the last cloud-init summit a couple of weeks ago.

 17:29 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: and rharper have been working on getting initial travis.yml together for allowing travis to run our CI tests.

 17:30 `<tribaal>` ohhh big news indeed!

 17:30 `<Odd_Bloke>` That has, indeed, landed.  You can see it at [https://github.com/cloud-init/cloud-init/blob/master/.travis.yml](https://github.com/cloud-init/cloud-init/blob/master/.travis.yml) (it's also in the Launchpad git repo, we're still syncing from there to GH ATM :).

 17:31 `<Odd_Bloke>` And you can see that we're green at [https://travis-ci.org/cloud-init/cloud-init](https://travis-ci.org/cloud-init/cloud-init)

 17:31 `<blackboxsw>` We are currently sorting out the rest of our CI, but the expectation for the community is that we'll soon have an announcement and simple procedure to get folks contributing with pull requests @ [https://github.com/cloud-init/cloud-init](https://github.com/cloud-init/cloud-init) instead of posting branch review requests at [https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init](https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init)

 17:31 `<tribaal>` very nice!

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` There will likely be a small transition set of steps needed for existing launchpad users to authenticate their github account because of the Canonical's contributor license agreement (CLA). But we are sorting that imminently

 17:33 `<tribaal>` ah that would make sese yeah

 17:34 `<blackboxsw>` we'll make every effort to reduce the amount of work for in-flight branches and get landed what we can prior to that transition to github. So, expect before next cloud-init status meeting that we have details about the switch

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` \#action mailing list update to cloud-init community about procedure/timeline for migration to github

 17:35 * meetingology mailing list update to cloud-init community about procedure/timeline for migration to github

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` we really want to leverage the active github community, public CI results, and ease of use and github is the best path forward for that

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` thanks Odd_Bloke and rharper for all the work there so far

 17:38 `<blackboxsw>` well. I think that about wraps the status meeting for this episode. Hope Halloween has more treat than trick for folks. See you next 11/05 16:15 UTC.

 17:38 `<blackboxsw>` thanks for participating chillysurfer & tribaal
