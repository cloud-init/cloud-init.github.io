 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` upstream is currently focused on getting in bug fixes, dropping remnants of py2 in tooling  reviewing active PRs to get cloud-init in shape for the upcoming 20.2 release

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` active pulls indended for the release should be up in github at [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls)

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` *intended* rather

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` his section is generally reserved to discuss any general community goals for cloud-init, at last cloud-init summit  we defined those goals as:

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` - datasource doc fixes

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` - json schema validation for each cloudinit/config/cc_*py modules

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` there are feature bugs created for these tasks at [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs)?field.tag=bitesize

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` During office hours a couple of upstream devs will have eyes on this channel. Any questions, comments, branch reviews are fair game for discussion.

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` In leiu of active discussions, developers will be grooming the active pull request review queue  to unblock branch authors.

 16:37 `<punkgeek>` Odd_Bloke: No it doesn't work. why there is no way to config cloud-init in kvm virtualization rather than iso, like vm xml file?

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` I'm getting through a belated review on [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/298](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/298)

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` punkgeek: like seeding ovf-env.xml? [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/master/doc/sources/ovf/README](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/blob/master/doc/sources/ovf/README)

 16:46 `<rharper>` punkgeek: you might want to look at virt-install , they recently have added support for providing cloud-config to VMs;  virt-install is a wrapper around creating VMs utilizing libvirt as a backend, [https://athinapl.home.blog/2019/08/25/gsoc-2019-cloud-init-configuration-for-virt-manager-virt-install/](https://athinapl.home.blog/2019/08/25/gsoc-2019-cloud-init-configuration-for-virt-manager-virt-install/)

 16:54 `<Goneri>` punkgeek, or you can take a look at virt-lightning

 16:54 `<Goneri>` punkgeek, it's basically a CLI to use libvirt+cloud-init

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` Goneri: review done. sorry for the delay on such a minor set of change requests [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/298/files\#](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/298/files\#)

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` [https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/uss-tableflip/pull/45](https://github.com/CanonicalLtd/uss-tableflip/pull/45) I think comments are resolved

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` I think we are at about the turn of the hour for cloud-init status. I'm going to review [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/305](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/305) next

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` thanks all for tuning in. see you next time
