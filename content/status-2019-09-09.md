 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` Additionally: we have also cut a stable-18.4 branch from the 18.4 tag as our last supported python2.6 branch. There will be an email sent out to the mailing list about the intent of this branch.  It requires a couple of minor fixes to make sure py2.6 support is functional, but this will be reference branch for any distribution that does not have access to py.27 or later.  No additional feature development is

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` planned on stable-18.4

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` a reminder again that python2.6 support was 'dropped' in cloud-init upstream as of the 18.4 release, so expectations for py2.6 support stopped  in 18.4 and there is a deprecation plan for py 2.7 as well

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` Again, see the mailinglist for details and updates

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` Last week or so the team has been working on SRU validation for cloud-init 19.2.24 into Xenial, Bionic and Disco.

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` We have passed all SRU validation tests and our expected pubish date for 19.2.24 is tomorrow for those Ubuntu series

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` good work on validation folks

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` and thanks for extra cloud-init community verification from exoscale, azure and VMware for validation efforts

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` There is additional Oracle, FreeBSD and Azure work in flight at the moment as well as some boot speed improvements and analysis from rharper

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` The following link represents any carded work upstream is  tracking. The Doing lane is content or features we expect to land shortly

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` Now is probably a good time to also mention that our entire ubuntu server team also reflects our weekly accomplishements over in the ubuntu-server discourse. If there are deeper discussions or questions on various topics or features please join us there as well

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server)

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` I think that about wraps it for in-progress development

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` upstream cloud-init devs will have eyes on this channel for any discussions, questions, bugs or feature work the greater community would like to discuss.

 16:49 `<blackboxsw>` During this time, we'll also groom our activereview queue to make sure we try to get review comments out to devs who have active branches.

 16:49 `<blackboxsw>` Again, thanks for tuning in

 16:57 `<blackboxsw>` Ok just addressed review comments on [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372432](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372432) .   I'm reviewing [https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368507](https://code.launchpad.net/~goneri/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/368507)

 16:59 * blackboxsw also sets the next meeting topic so we don't forget.

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: rharper powersj, I *think* we decided to shift from Mondays to Tuesdays for status meetings to avoid collisions with holidays, vacation work travel etc. Are we doing that for next status meeting, or maybe waiting to discuss that more broadly?

 17:02 `<Odd_Bloke>` Tuesday in two weeks is likely to be a travel day for anyone heading to the cloud-init summit.

 17:02 `<Odd_Bloke>` But Monday is likely to be a swap day for Canonical folks because we're all travelling next week too.

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` hrm right, maybe we wait then and discuss at the summit

 17:03 `<Odd_Bloke>` So I would perhaps suggest skipping the next meeting, and then we can resume on Tuesdays two weeks after the summit?

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` discuss scheduling changes that is

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` sure, let's push/postpone until summit +2 weeks

 17:05 `<blackboxsw>` \#action blackboxsw send email to the list notifying of status meeting day change.

 17:05 * meetingology blackboxsw send email to the list notifying of status meeting day change.

 17:10 `<rharper>` +1 Odd_Bloke

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` Also note that the version of cloud-init that has undergone SRU verification is also published to our copr el-testing repo. We only update that repo during upstream cloud-init releases XX.YY and any Ubuntu SRUs so it is much more stable than our daily copr repo.

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/el-testing/](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/cloud-init/el-testing/)

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` I think that about wraps our cloud-init status meeting for today. I'm wrapping up my review here and will post it to the set_passwords branch.

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
