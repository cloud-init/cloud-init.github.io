 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` We have also published commits though "    - Azure: Record boot timestamps, system information, and diagnostic events"   to Ubuntu Eoan (19.10) (cloud-init v.19.2-13) if folks want a glimpse of those features

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` Many thanks to Azure and GCE folks for their commits and a hi five to tribaal for adding Exoscale

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` As always, we try to keep most of our work up to date in trello

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` cards in the "Reviewing" column should represent the work we expect to have up for review in the short term.

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` rharper is mid-stream on some investigations that will likely lead to significant speed improvements for cloud-init

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: is working on some significant improvements for Oracle's datasource rendering network config

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` and I'm working on getting OpenStack and Ec2 datasources to talk network config v2.

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` beyond that work we have a pretty healther active review queue

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+activereviews](https://code.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+activereviews)

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` of note, some freebsd work is in flight, gce dns improvements, udev triggers and OVF handling user-defined scripts.

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` We

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` will spend the latter part of this meeting looking over the review queue to see that open branches are in the proper state

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` Also, our plan for this week is to cut a Cloud-init SRU (Stable release update) for upload into xenial, bionic and disco.

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` expectation is that those Ubuntu series will see an update for cloud-init after our ~7 days of testing and verification

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` rharper: Odd_Bloke anything else in flight that we should note here?

 16:34 `<rharper>` that looks like everything

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` without further ado, we can transition to office hours

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` We're here for any questions, bugs, discussions people would like to have around cloud-init. This block of time is available for any discussions or requests people may have.

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` We will also spend this time grooming the active review queue to make sure developers get any needed feedback on their active branches.

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` If there are any branches that need more eyes, please bring them up here or make sure they are in the 'Needs review' state in Launchpad

 16:38 `<tribaal>` blackboxsw: thanks!

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` tribaal: good work. I think Odd_Bloke landed the followup work to enable exoscale datasource config to cloud-init.templates to 'enable' it. And looks like that has landed

 16:40 `<tribaal>` blackboxsw: I'm happy to help verify SRU bugs when the process is kicked - just let me know

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` so it's 'on' in Eoan, once SRU is kicked off, it'll be in there

 16:41 `<tribaal>` yep, I need to push an Eoan template to our preprod environment tomorrow to kick the tires, but I don't expect anything funny

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` tribaal: will do. I think the only thing we are waiting on before SRU is landing this ubuntu-drivers branch  [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/371369](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/371369)

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` any feedback on behavior your in Eoan from you tribaal would be helpful.

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` let's try that in English this time:  any feedback on the behavior in your Eoan environment would be helpful tribaal.

 16:43 `<tribaal>` blackboxsw: haha that's what I inferred :)

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` :) /me hits the review queue

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` rharper: if you get a chance: you've landed [https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init/commit/](https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init/commit/)?id=b3a87fc0.   Do we also still need the following branch? [https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/363571](https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/363571)

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` If so, I'll spend this time trying to write up unit tests for this if possible

 16:48 `<rharper>` blackboxsw: I don't think so; my branch should include all the needs of that branch

 16:49 `<rharper>` and the branch tests the wait_for_physdev as well as updates the opensuse net render paths to account for the udev rule number change

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` that's kindof what I was thinking/hoping.  I'll mark it rejected in favor of your commit, and we'll see what robjo thinks on that. We can reopen and try to address the unit test aspect of his branch if still needed.

 16:50 `<rharper>` I think we can mark that branch closed

 16:50 `<rharper>` robjo: had already looked at the branch before landing

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` ok done

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` thanks Florian for your first commit! [https://code.launchpad.net/~florian-mueller-v/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/371298](https://code.launchpad.net/~florian-mueller-v/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/371298)  ... doc update approved

 16:58 `<robjo>` I don't recall having looked at [https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init/commit/](https://git.launchpad.net/cloud-init/commit/)?id=b3a87fc0 and there was no entry in the bug to remind me that I did. Anyway, I've done so now and yes, this obsoletes [https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/363571](https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/363571)

 17:00 `<blackboxsw>` thank you robjo for that

 17:04 `<rharper>` robjo: [https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/366667](https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/366667)  ;  yes, I should have linked to the bug in my MP

 17:04 `<rharper>` you did take a look a while back though

 17:06 `<robjo>` rharper: I believe you, just cannot remember....

 17:06 `<rharper>` heh, it was a while back

 17:24 `<blackboxsw>` I think we should probably wrap up the meeting for this week.  I've got one more review to clear.

 17:24 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks again all for joining. minutes will be posted to github
