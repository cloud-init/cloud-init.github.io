 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` The team in general is perparing for the cloud-init summit conference which will be the second half of this week with cloud and distro vendors so we'll probably be landing a couple more branches in preparation for talks/demos there.

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` recently powersj has also moved our jenkins server around to a new network so there has been a good bit of work getting all things jenkins back up and running behind the new proxies/firewalls etc.
