 17:29 `<powersj>` thought we were going to use pastebin :P

 17:29 `<blackboxsw>` heh, that is a good point (I wondered if anyone would call me on that)

 17:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/3jQdKZVPcM/](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/3jQdKZVPcM/)

 17:31 `<blackboxsw>` generally speaking, dropping use of six since our code based is not python3-only, tooling dropping py2,  sysconfig rendering flavors for opensuse, doc fixes and read the docs fixups

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` thanks all for the contributions over the last couple weeks

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic  In-progress Development,

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic  In-progress Development

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` Any existing PRs are up for review at the following url:

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls)

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` generally speaking we are in the 'long tail' part of a couple of feature-sets:

 17:34 `<blackboxsw>` * we are trying to wrap up tooling for our automated CI,  publishing processes and documentation for the shift to github from launchpad

 17:34 `<blackboxsw>` * we are in progress on cloud-init handling network hotplug  for a couple of datasources

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` * in progress on boot speed improvements for various platforms

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` We also recently validated and released cloud-init v 19.4.33 to Xenial, Bionic and Eoan  (1/9/2020)

 17:38 `<ahosmanMSFT>` Hi @blackboxsw I'm no longer in the provisioning team, but there's an urgency for the cloud test to be resilient. Have you looked at those issues, I can dedicate as much time as needed to this. If you have time, can we tackle this today?

 17:38 `<blackboxsw>` there are also a number of PRs in flight for FreeBSD,NetBSD, OpenSUSE and CentOS that need attention so we can better enable those distros

 17:38 `<ahosmanMSFT>` azurecloudtest that is

 17:39 `<blackboxsw>` hi ahosmanMSFT I can spend some time on office hours here to peek more at it. my individual runs didn't hit the timeouts again, so we might need a reproducer cmdline from you in a new bug maybe?

 17:39 `<ahosmanMSFT>` So your able to run all tests successfully without timeout and image not building>`

 17:40 `<blackboxsw>` ahosmanMSFT: but yes I can spend a little time on this today. and I think ultimately we'll have to find the tox command line that exhibits this error. I'll go checkout my test run again and see. I don't think I saw the failure. but I might be invoking tests differently than you

 17:41 `<ahosmanMSFT>` blackboxsw: hmm that's interesting, thanks let me know

 17:41 `<blackboxsw>` same here ahosmanMSFT, can you file a bug with the traceback you see and the tox cmdline you are running?

 17:41 `<blackboxsw>` then I know exactly what to look for

 17:42 `<ahosmanMSFT>` Sure, will do now

 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` cool.

 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` ok next topic

 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` ok this section is reserved to raise general community work/goals.

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` At last cloud-init summit we raised a couple of general themes of improvements cloud-init would like to achieve

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` These themes fell into two categories for this year: datasource documentation updates and cloud-init json schema validation for the 50+ config modules in cloudinit/config/cc_*py  so that we can better raise user-config errors and remove some of cloud-init's "sharp edges"

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` we converted a number of these feature requests in into bugs which can be searched here:

 17:46 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs)?field.tag=bitesize

 17:46 `<blackboxsw>` tasks in this list should be fairly easy one-time bugs for folks with a little time available to help improve cloud-init.

 17:47 `<blackboxsw>` we'll revisit this set of bugs/features and the community charter goals near the end of 2020 at the next cloud-init summit

 17:47 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 17:48 `<blackboxsw>` this time is spent with cloud-init upstream dev eyes on this channel for any cloud-init feature, bug  or implementation discussions. In the absence of such discussions, we'll review the active PRs to try to tidy up the review queue and unblock developers

 17:49 `<blackboxsw>` for the moment, I'll look over some Azure test timeouts ahosmanMSFT is seeing

 17:49 `<blackboxsw>` any other topics, concerns, bugs, questions are welcome and someone should be around to field them

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` ahosmanMSFT: so timeouts running integration tests, you said you are getting them about half the time?

 18:48 `<ahosmanMSFT>` blackboxsw: Yes, I tracked it down to platforms/instance._wait_for_system

 18:49 `<ahosmanMSFT>` I invoke it after initializing vm in platform/azurecloudtest/instance.start

 18:49 `<ahosmanMSFT>` when removed, everything works as expected

 18:50 `<ahosmanMSFT>` looks like it's needed for cloud tests so thought I'd leave it to you, since I don't know how ec2/lxd/... rely on

 18:50 `<powersj>` ahosmanMSFT, can you file a bug please with the cli example?

 18:50 `<powersj>` that would help us triage and make a proper decision on what change to make

 18:51 `<ahosmanMSFT>` powersj, yes, was in the middle of that side tracked by meeting. On it now

 18:51 `<powersj>` thanks!

 19:07 `<blackboxsw>` aaaand, I should probably wrap the meeting for the day.

 19:08 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks all for the time and energy you put into improving cloud-init! See you next time, or anytime in between

 19:08 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
