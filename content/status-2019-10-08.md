 16:18 `<meetingology>` Meeting started Tue Oct  8 16:18:28 2019 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw. Information about MeetBot at [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.)

 16:18 `<meetingology>` Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` Welcome back folks o/ And thanks AnhVoMSFT for the ping to get us started

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair rharper Odd_Bloke

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair rharper Odd_Bloke

 16:19 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: Odd_Bloke blackboxsw rharper

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` cloud-init upstream uses this meeting as a platform for community updates, feature/bug discussions, and an opportunity to get some extra input on current development.

 16:19 `<Odd_Bloke>` o/

 16:19 `<Odd_Bloke>` Thanks for the reminder, Anh.

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` Feel free to interject at any time. Our typical format is the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` For this, and subsequent, status meetings I proposed we add a new topic: Ongoing Community Charter  which would give context on the new trello lane we added at the cloud-init summit.

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: rharper AnhVoMSFT does that sound good? We can then better advertise and remind about long-term community involvement projects that are available for anyone

 16:22 `<AnhVoMSFT>` I would propose that the last agenda item of any status meeting would be to update the banner to reflect the next status meeting - and perhaps the next ETA for next release / SRU

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` +1 AnhVoMSFT that sounds good too.

 16:22 `<AnhVoMSFT>` yep, sounds good on the Community Charter

 16:22 `<rharper>` AnhVoMSFT: +1

 16:22 `<rharper>` I think one topic each

 16:22 `<rharper>` and end with the next status meeting

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks Brian, Shixin Ruan, Conrad Hoffmann, Adam Dobrawy and robjo for the contributions over the last month!

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` beyond tip commits to cloud-init the upstream team went through two SRUs of cloud-init

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` it's also excellent to see new datasources like the  RbxCloud datasource added

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` cloud-init just passed validation for Ubuntu Xenial, Bionic and Disco on the 2nd SRU 19.2-36-g059d049c-0ubuntu2

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` cloud-images today should have that updated revision in them I blieve

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` there are fixes for both Azure accelerated networking support and handling issues seen on MAAS network bridge configuration

 16:32 `<AnhVoMSFT>` on that note the last Azure image we had published was early September, which still didn't have the first SRU

 16:32 `<AnhVoMSFT>` is there something going on with the image publishing pipeline again?

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` AnhVoMSFT: the publishing pipeline paused while we sorted the 2nd SRU pass for maas network bridge issues introduced by 19.2-36-g059d049c-0ubuntu1

 16:33 `<AnhVoMSFT>` i see - that makes sense

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` 19.2-36-g059d049c-0ubuntu2 was verified as fixing all support there for both Azure and MAAS datasources and the expectation is that image builds are continuing today but I'll verify that the box is ✔ there on images rebuilding

 16:34 `<Odd_Bloke>` There may also be Azure-specific publication pipeline issues, which we wouldn't necessarily know about off-hand.

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` \#action blackboxsw verify cpc image builds are unpaused/unblocked for Azure

 16:34 * meetingology blackboxsw verify cpc image builds are unpaused/unblocked for Azure

 16:34 `<blackboxsw>` thx Odd_Bloke right

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` looks like Odd_Bloke is already on that verification internally

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` ok so SRU is through verification on our side. cloudimages should be getting latest version of cloud-init for Xenial, Bionic and Disco imminently

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` I think that is *it* for Recent Changes

 16:36 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` the SRU verification work took a bit of steam out of our current work in progress as it involved a lot of manual and upgrade scenario tests.

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` But, as always we try to track ongoing work in trello

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` there are a number of branches in progress that are of interest:

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` Azure CI for one would be a great add for cloud-init's CI infrastructure

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` [https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957](https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957)

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` we need to get eyes on that this week if we can

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` \#action cloud-init upstream review [https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957](https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957)

 16:39 * meetingology cloud-init upstream review [https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957](https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957)

 16:39 `<ahosmanmsft>` That would be great

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` there are also a number of freebsd branches that need to close out.

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` and I know Odd_Bloke has started peeking at some initial github integration for CI.

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: any details you want to add about github CI at the moment?

 16:41 `<Odd_Bloke>` I've started iterating on a Travis configuration to run what we currently run in our CI pipeline.

 16:41 `<Odd_Bloke>` Unsurprisingly, setting up linting/unit testing was easy.

 16:42 `<Odd_Bloke>` The other thing we do is run some integration testing from a built deb file.  I got as far as being able to successfully sbuild the package in Travis, and ran into some initial stumbling blocks with running lxd.

 16:42 `<Odd_Bloke>` That's as far as I've got, I expect to pick that work back up this week.

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` thanks Odd_Bloke , I've added the following card to trello for those interested.

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/c/pqA1adVM/1195-investigate-adding-github-travis-ci-to-cloud-init](https://trello.com/c/pqA1adVM/1195-investigate-adding-github-travis-ci-to-cloud-init)

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` I think that about wraps in progress work. We'll tackle reviews a bit at the end of the meeting

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` ok next topic

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` at the cloud-init summit we decided to highlight community work in trello so that any community member with some dev cycles and interest can join in and contribute to ongoing tasks

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` that lane is now in trello representing low-hanging-fruit content that upstream cloud-init is interested in completing, and that anyone can commit to.

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` the lane is labelled "Community low-hanging-fruit" and currently contains a number of doc update work items  as well as json schema validation extensions for each cloud-init config module

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` we invite everyone to participate and feel free to grab those items as they have interest

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` we'll revisit this topic in each meeting so folks have context

 16:47 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Upcoming meetings and releases

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` cloud-init upstream has just passed validation of cloud-init 19.2.36-*-ubuntu2  which should approved for upload into Xenial, Disco and Bionic (and queued for Eoan)

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` the cloud build team will be generating images for various clouds imminently and we will confirm that build pipelines are active so platforms get new bits asap

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` 19.3 upstream should by coming shortly, we will update the topic with the expected upstream release date and send an  email to the mailing list with the estimated upstream cut

 16:51 `<blackboxsw>` \#action upstream cloud-init email about 19.3 release date

 16:51 * meetingology upstream cloud-init email about 19.3 release date

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` next meeting is Oct 22

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` same bat time same bat channel

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` we spend this time for reviews, bug triage and cloud-init discussions.

 16:53 `<blackboxsw>` upstream devs should have eyes on this channel. Thanks everyone for tuning in

 16:54 `<AnhVoMSFT>` have you had a chance to discuss about the python deprecation issue, or did the SRU verification take most of the time since the summit

 16:58 `<blackboxsw>` AnhVoMSFT: last week was vacation plus the remainder of us on sru verification  .

 17:00 `<blackboxsw>` But now we have cleared that hurdle we should we able to discuss it this week.

 17:00 `<AnhVoMSFT>` yep, sounds good.

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` \#action revisit python deprecation and report to mailinglist

 17:01 * meetingology revisit python deprecation and report to mailinglist

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` Good meeting for actions

 17:54 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks for the participation folks I'll publish minutes to github
