 16:08 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting Cloud-init bi-weekly status meeting

 16:08 `<meetingology>` Meeting started Tue Sep  4 16:08:21 2018 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw. Information about MeetBot at [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.)

 16:08 `<meetingology>` 

 16:08 `<meetingology>` Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 16:08 `<marcoceppi>` rharper: oddly enough, that didn't work. root wasn't set

 16:08 `<marcoceppi>` I'll bother you all after the meeting

 16:08 `<blackboxsw>` or during marcoceppi :) sorry for the delay folks, I lost internet for a bit and just got it back up.

 16:09 `<blackboxsw>` let's kickoff the bi-weekly status meeting and see what discussion we have for today

 16:09 `<blackboxsw>` Our agenda is the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress development and office hours (~30 minutes)

 16:09 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` the only logged action per last meeting was the following:

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` rharper/blackboxsw close out on this review before cloud-init summit [https://code.launchpad.net/~andyliuliming/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/351742](https://code.launchpad.net/~andyliuliming/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/351742)

 16:11 `<blackboxsw>` we were able to land that branch at the cloud-init summit 2 weeks ago and also landed a followup fix for a lock race condition related to that changeset

 16:11 `<blackboxsw>` so we can cross that one off the list

 16:11 `<blackboxsw>` .... and for those following from home. our meeting minutes from the last status meeting are here

 16:11 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/](https://cloud-init.github.io/)

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` Also generically we had a number of action items that came out of our Seattle cloud-init summit with various cloud and distribution partners. Our team will be having a review meeting to discuss some of those actions/decisions and ultimately convert them into trello work items on our board

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` Over the  last couple weeks Microsoft hosted a very producting Cloud-init Summit conference in Seattle. A number of clouds and distribution vendors participated to set goals for the cloud-init upstream project.  powersj wrote up a nice post to capture some of that work. Thank you all for partipating and helping to improve cloud-init

 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://powersj.github.io/post/cloud-init-summit18/](https://powersj.github.io/post/cloud-init-summit18/)

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` also the following changes landed upstream:

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - Add unit tests for config/cc_ssh.py [Francis Ginther]

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - Fix the built-in cloudinit/tests/helpers:skipIf

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - read-version: enhance error message [Joshua Powers]

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - hyperv_reporting_handler: simplify threaded publisher

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - VMWare: Fix a network config bug in vm with static IPv4 and no gateway.

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` [Pengpeng Sun] (LP: \#1766538)

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - logging: Add logging config type hyperv for reporting via Azure KVP

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` [Andy Liu]

 16:21 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1766538 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "network customization with cloud-init does not work on Ubuntu18.04 Beta2 Server" [Medium,Confirmed] [https://launchpad.net/bugs/1766538](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1766538)

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` as always, check our board if there are questions about what we are working on the cloud-init side of the house. any cloud-init cards will have a cloud-init label

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)?menu=filter&filter=cloud-init

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` we are working a couple of fixes for Oracle as well as the following features that could be interesting to folks:

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` - the ability to use jinja templating in cloud-config or user-scripts to reference any standardized instance meta data cloud-init consumes

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` - allowing new ssh user config in \#cloud-config to specify a ssh-redirect-user, which would allow someone to disable an existing ssh user and provide a redirect message mentioning which username is the preferred default user

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` - ryan is working on refactoring the sysconfig renderer align multiple distros,  so that we don't have slightly different implementations in cloud-init for each distribution

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/353740](https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/353740)

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` beyond that, there a number of new contibutions that have been generated by some of the amazon folks that we plan on reviewing and landing for better amazon linux support

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` thanks again for all the good work. I think we'll transition to the open forum for any discussion/feature/bug work.

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic  Office Hource (next ~30 mins)

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` we'll have eyes on this channel for the next 30 mins. any topic is acceptable; big or small. Bugs, discussions, features, complaints etc.

 16:31 `<smoser>` o/

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` sorry for the interrupt earlier :)

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` Since we have a clear discussion docket for office hours...    At the summit we decided maybe it would be a good idea to try reviewing our active review queue to keep the momentum going there and avoid stale branches sitting unresolved for a while.

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` smoser: rharper you gents up for taking a swing at our review queue in this forum to see if we can prioritize what needs landing/response etc?

 16:41 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Active review queue scrub (and open discussion/office hours)

 16:42 `<smoser>` sure.

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` I wanted  to see if we could land Praveen's branch for Amazon linux support.

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~praween/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/353733](https://code.launchpad.net/~praween/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/353733)

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` their CI needs a new makefile target "sources"

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` I suggested that maybe they add that functionality into ./packages/brpm instead of just the commands on the cli

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` since we use brpm in our ci too. ....

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` Praveen had agreed at the summit to make some changes to extend brpm with a new cmdline option to do this work. But I don't see anything pushed.   I'd like to mark this work in progress and comment to that affect. sound good?

 16:46 `<smoser>` blackboxsw: that sounds good

 16:49 `<blackboxsw>` smoser: ok [https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/354001](https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/354001)  I'll grab today after this meeting so we can land all the  leaky unit tests. geez man

 16:49 * blackboxsw grabs the review slot

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` I believe robert's branch is tabled until ryan's sysconfig branch is landed

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/333904](https://code.launchpad.net/~rjschwei/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/333904)

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` ^ should we mark this 'work in progress' as it's blocked? or maybe just leave it in the active queue

 16:51 `<smoser>` blackboxsw: your needs information still stands right?

 16:51 `<smoser>` lets move it to work-in-progress and ask for response and also ask if it is sitll necessary (unless you know that it is or is not)

 16:52 `<smoser>` and suggest that it will need to be re-worked.

 16:53 `<blackboxsw>` smoser: that sounds good. my 'needs information' on that is resolved/read/discussed already. so I should abstain for the moment until the rework

 16:57 `<blackboxsw>` ok couple more minutes... any additional reviews we should look at in earnest  now?

 16:58 `<blackboxsw>` I kinda want to hold on [https://code.launchpad.net/~tamilmani1989/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/336392](https://code.launchpad.net/~tamilmani1989/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/336392) until we have our summit retro meeting today

 16:59 `<blackboxsw>` here's a short one. [https://code.launchpad.net/~otubo/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/353436.](https://code.launchpad.net/~otubo/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/353436.) should we mark this 'work in progress' until smoser's review comments are addressed and unit tests added?

 16:59 `<smoser>` blackboxsw: yeah. i'll do that.

 17:00 `<blackboxsw>` ok thanks. and I think that'll about wrap it for today. If we don't resolve the other community reviews by next status meeting, we can continue chipping away at this queue then.

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` I'll post the minutes to cloudinit.github.io just after this.

 17:01 `<smoser>` blackboxsw: i'm loking at rharper's mp now for the system config

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` ok I'll get your review on [https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/354001](https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/354001) now

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
