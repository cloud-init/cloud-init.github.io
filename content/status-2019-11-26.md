 17:24 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: Odd_Bloke blackboxsw

 17:24 `<blackboxsw>` Hi folks welcome to another cloud-init status meeting.

 17:24 `<blackboxsw>` cloud-init upstream uses this meeting as a platform for community updates, feature/bug discussions, and an opportunity to get some extra input on current development.

 17:25 `<blackboxsw>` And as you've likely heard, we are shifting this meeting by +1 hr for the season to avoid meeting collisions with some of the upstream devs

 17:25 `<blackboxsw>` I'll set the topic for next meeting so we don't forget

 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` so Dec 10th, two weeks from today, same time as today

 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` without further ado, let's jump into things

 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` Feel free to interject at any time. Our typical format is the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Community Charter, Upcoming Meetings, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` I'm going from our last meeting minutes at the following url

 17:28 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2019-10-29.html\#status-2019-10-29](https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2019-10-29.html\#status-2019-10-29)

 17:29 `<blackboxsw>` blackboxsw to verify cpc image builds are unpaused/unblocked for Azure (we were able to confirm the the CPC clound image builds for Azure were on time for the two cloud-init SRUs and worked that communication side-channel with Microsoft.

 17:29 `<blackboxsw>` I did forward the proper Microsoft channel contact to other Microsoft dev teams working on cloud-init

 17:30 `<blackboxsw>` so I think thats COMPLETE

 17:31 `<blackboxsw>` Also to note is that cloud image builds though are still stale for Azure & Ec2 on focal. There are a couple of bugs in the image build process that Canonical's cloud image team is sorting to get those image builders unblocked

 17:31 `<blackboxsw>` Xenial, Bionic, Eoan images all look up to date

 17:32 `<chillysurfer>` bug reports and issues are still going to be reported through launchpad right?

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` previous-action: cloud-init upstream discuss where/how/if to host documentation on supported and planned schedule for cloud-init versions for debian/suse/redhat/ubuntu/freebsd etc.   Resolved. Upstream decided that it was going to be a bit of a maintenance cost to have a full table of all distributions and all versions of cloud-init as well as the planned support plan.

 17:32 `<blackboxsw>` chillysurfer: +1 yes please do. file away and we'll tackle that

 17:32 `<chillysurfer>` blackboxsw: great thanks!

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` previous-action:  mailing list update to cloud-init community about procedure/timeline for migration to github. rharper took care of that per

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` \#link  [https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00231.html](https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00231.html)

 17:34 `<blackboxsw>` Again for folks, we have moved cloud-init upstream to github for code and CI. Launchpad still being used for package build recipes and bugs/ issues

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` If you have signed the CLA (thanks ahosmanMSFT) then we need to link your github account to the Lauchpad username you signed the CLA with.  See the hacking doc for more information

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/hacking.html](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/hacking.html)

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` Think that wraps actions.

 17:39 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 17:40 `<ahosmanMSFT>` Looking into this

 17:40 `<ahosmanMSFT>` Launchpad bug 1849677 in cloud-init "azure locks existing user if instance id changes" [Medium,Fix committed] [https://launchpad.net/bugs/1849677](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1849677)

 17:40 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1849677 in cloud-init "azure locks existing user if instance id changes" [Medium,Fix committed]

 17:40 `<blackboxsw>` As meena mentioned there is a lot of work going on to improve FreeBSD support.

 17:40 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks do3meli and meena for that herculean effort

 17:41 `<blackboxsw>` ahosmanMSFT: also has be working on getting Azure CI up and running. That branch will land just as soon as this meeting is over

 17:41 `<blackboxsw>` we also have landed a significant AWS feature for IMDSv2.

 17:42 `<blackboxsw>` It looks like we'll have a bug to sort on that front

 17:42 `<chillysurfer>` bug report just opened up

 17:42 `<chillysurfer>` [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1854084](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bug/1854084)

 17:42 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1854084 in cloud-init "Headers no longer passed through read_file_or_url" [Undecided,New]

 17:42 `<blackboxsw>` thanks chillysurfer !

 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` will get on that today and confirm

 17:43 `<chillysurfer>` blackboxsw: great thanks! let me know what you think when you know some things

 17:43 `<blackboxsw>` will do

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` also in the "In progress" topic are the WIP branches that rharper has up to lay ground work for opting in to cloud-init hotplug support

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/48](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/48)

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/47](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/47)

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` we'll be trying to pull in hotplug functionality into this cycle, so expect work land on that front before 19.4 I'm guessing

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` sorry I mean version 20.1

 17:46 `<blackboxsw>` ok next topic

 17:46 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 17:46 `<meena>` i want to test Goneri's network [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/61](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/61) , but a prerequisite to make that easier is [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/42](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/42) and it appears only rharper knows how to write tests for that part of the code

 17:47 `<meena>` what's hotplug support mean in this context?

 17:48 `<blackboxsw>` This Community Charter topic is a placeholder to remind anyone with some spare cycles that as a community anyone can drop in for low-hanging fruit or discrete tasks that will contribute to a better cloud-init

 17:48 `<blackboxsw>` the community charter is currently:

 17:48 `<blackboxsw>` 1. updated datasource docs

 17:48 `<blackboxsw>` 2. get json schema implementation writting for each cloudinit.config.cc_*py module

 17:49 `<Goneri>` meena, I can generate some prebuilt images with my last patch

 17:49 `<blackboxsw>` those items are cards on our trello board in the community low-hanging-fruit lane that anyone grab and work

 17:49 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` ...  sorry meena, needed to finish my thought.  so we'd like review and closure on 42?

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` >`>` what's hotplug support mean in this context?     hotplug network device events currently would be the baseline.

 17:51 `<blackboxsw>` so network config would be rewritten as devices show up or disappear

 17:51 `<blackboxsw>` if someone opts into cloud-init controlling the running network config post-boot

 17:52 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Upcoming Meetings

 17:52 `<blackboxsw>` as set earlier. Dec 10th for another status meeting at this hour

 17:52 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 17:53 `<blackboxsw>` This time is a chance for open discussions really on any cloud-init topic. bugs, issues, branches that need review etc. In the absence of other discussion, devs will be hitting the review queue to chip away at existing  PRs  to keep them from getting stale

 17:56 `<meena>` blackboxsw: yes, please, 42 fix would be good

 17:59 `<blackboxsw>` ok looking now

 17:59 `<blackboxsw>` ahosmanMSFT: I'm landing your Azure CI first

 18:04 `<blackboxsw>` ahosmanMSFT: would you like to provide me with a bit more information in the commit message [https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957](https://code.launchpad.net/~ahosmanmsft/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/372957) for enabling Azure integration testing?  the 'commit message' in the UI will be the final message shown in cloud-init logs and it might be nice to have a bit more context

 18:04 `<ahosmanMSFT>` blackboxsw Adding now

 18:04 `<blackboxsw>` thank you sir

 18:14 `<ahosmanMSFT>` blackboxsw take a look and let me know if I should add anything

 18:15 `<ahosmanMSFT>` Added Azure to cloud tests supporting upstream integration testing. This Implements the inherited platform classes, Azure configurationsto release/platform, and docs on how to run Azure CI.

 18:44 `<blackboxsw>` meena: I may come up with an alternative suggestion to address smoser's suggestion to run dmidecode once. it's a bit of a lift though as dmidecode output isn't structured very easy to parse

 19:00 `<blackboxsw>` ahh I should close out the meeting

 19:00 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks folks for attending. Until next time use the IRC channel or mailing list

 19:00 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
