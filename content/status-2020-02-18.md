 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting Cloud-init bi-weekly status

 17:35 `<meetingology>` 

 17:35 `<meetingology>` Available commands: action commands idea info link nick

 17:35 `<blackboxsw>` o/  hi cloud-init folks. sorry I botched being able to read calendars last time.

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` let's kick off our cloud-init status meeting.

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` notes from previous meeting are here:

 17:36 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2020-02-04.html\#status-2020-02-04](https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2020-02-04.html\#status-2020-02-04)

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` the topics we cover in this meeting are the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Community Charter, Upcoming Meetings, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` today I'll add a topic for cloud-init's upstream release  20.1

 17:37 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 17:38 `<blackboxsw>` Last meeting minutes show no carryover action items. So we can drop into recent changes

 17:38 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 17:40 `<blackboxsw>` We have about 8 commits landed in master since last meeting: found with git log --since 02-04-2020

 17:40 `<blackboxsw>` [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/28Y8jGTGwr/](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/28Y8jGTGwr/)

 17:41 `<blackboxsw>` some doc fixes, CI fixes for Azure integration testing , swap disk support for cc_disk_setup  and freebsd improvements.

 17:42 `<blackboxsw>` thanks for contributions there all. I think we still have a long tail of improvements to review for FreeBSD and NetBSD so we'll try to keep the conversation going there.. Thanks meena and do3meli there

 17:42 `<blackboxsw>` I mean Goneri

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair rharper Odd_Bloke smoser

 17:44 `<meetingology>` Warning: Nick not in channel: rharper

 17:44 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: Odd_Bloke blackboxsw rharper smoser

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` forgot to set meeting chairs. sry

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-prgoress Development

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 17:47 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: is currently wrapping up any remaining py2/p3-isms in master branch. Dropping use of 'six' throughout the code. Paride is working on copr-build failures due to the shift to python3 packages. otubo, thanks for the ping back on finding various python3 CentOS packages. We'll also try sorting this this week so cloud-init py3 builds can work on CentOS 7 and 8

 17:47 `<blackboxsw>` If folks didn't see the mailing list Odd_Bloke has a branch up to shift from nosetests ->` pytest [https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00245.html](https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00245.html)

 17:48 `<blackboxsw>` we expect to land that after 20.1 releases. Thanks for the reviews there [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/211](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/211)

 17:49 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic cloud-init upstream 20.1

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` So, today at EOD is upstream release day for cloud-init 20.1. Just another timed release of cloud-init which we strive to make quarterly thoughout the year

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` As mentioned on the mailing list, if there are any branches/PRs that folks really would like to get into 20.1, please raise them here. We will scrub the review queue today and see what makes sense to land for this release.

 17:52 `<Odd_Bloke>` I'll be driving the 20.1 release.

 17:53 `<Odd_Bloke>` We just landed [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/204](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/204) into master, which is a fix for a (low priority) CVE that we wanted in before cutting the release.

 17:54 `<Odd_Bloke>` I'm going to perform some testing of that change before cutting the release, to determine if any doc changes are required for it and to check if it impacts boot on Azure instances that have a password provided by the Azure fabric.

 17:54 `<blackboxsw>` I was just looking over the PR from fred in ec2 land about handling a disabled path for IMDSv2  that looks interesting, but it still needs unit tests [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/216/files](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/216/files)

 17:55 `<blackboxsw>` this would certainly help non-ec2 lookalikes

 17:55 `<blackboxsw>` and is a fairly specific fix.

 17:56 `<blackboxsw>` we can peek over it during the office hours and see if it makes sense.

 17:56 `<blackboxsw>` Thanks Odd_Bloke for driving the 20.1 release.

 17:56 `<blackboxsw>` So, again, plan is to cut 20.1 at end of day today.

 17:58 `<blackboxsw>` What follows will be a tag and release to Ubuntu Focal to sync tip of master to Ubuntu development release

 17:59 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 17:59 `<blackboxsw>` This topic is a placeholder to remind folks of any project-wide development tasks that we are engaging the community in.

 18:00 `<blackboxsw>` the general theme at the moment is cloud-config schema definitions for the config modules in cloudinit/config/cc_*py and improving/correct datasource configuration documentation

 18:00 `<blackboxsw>` We've queued this work as separate bugs in cloud-init at the following link

 18:01 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs)?field.tag=bitesize

 18:01 `<blackboxsw>` we'll revisit this set of bugs/features and resent community charter goals near the end of 2020 at the next cloud-init summit. If there are suggestions/desires for community themed tasks please feel free to set the direction there.

 18:02 `<blackboxsw>` these community tasks are grabbed by any contributor to cloud-init.

 18:03 `<blackboxsw>` An example of the schema definitions we are looking to add is the PR in review here. [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/152](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/152)

 18:04 `<blackboxsw>` As always, everyone's review counts. As a project we are trying to also look to 'promote' more core-contributors, with commit rights to the cloud-init project. Reviews count just much as proposing pull requests to the project.

 18:04 `<blackboxsw>` thanks again for all the contributions, reviews and bugs that are being contributed to date. It really helps improve this project's use

 18:05 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 18:07 `<blackboxsw>` During this topic, please bring up any questions, discussions, bugs or features or paper cuts that need attention. there should be a couple of cloud-init developers with eyes on the channel to actively respond.

 18:08 `<blackboxsw>` In leiu of active discussions, we'll hit up the review queue for cloud-init at [https://git.io/JeVed](https://git.io/JeVed)  and get ready for the 20.1  release

 18:09 `<blackboxsw>` I'm going to see if I can

 18:09 `<blackboxsw>` review  [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/216/files](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/216/files) and propose the unit test changes there

 18:09 `<blackboxsw>` I think that could be a valid addition for ec2-lookalikes to avoid an unnecessary 2 minute timeout

 18:09 `<blackboxsw>` on boot

 18:19 `<blackboxsw>` hrm on 2nd thought w/ 216, I think that patch set should  be more specific, such as actually testing HTTP status 403 instead of just checking if metadata was None and assuming it was disabled. I'll put a couple of review comments on that as I dig in, but probably not in a state that it could be landed today

 18:36 `<blackboxsw>` thanks for tuning in folks.  See you next time

 18:36 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
