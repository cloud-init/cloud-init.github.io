 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting Cloud-init bi-weekly status

 16:22 `<meetingology>` Meeting started Tue Mar 10 16:22:58 2020 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw. Information about MeetBot at [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.)

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` Hello and welcome to another cloud-init community status meeting.

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` our IRC channel topic carries the next planned status meeting for those that wish to participate.

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` All are welcome and interruptions encouraged

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` \#chair rharper Odd_Bloke smoser

 16:23 `<meetingology>` Current chairs: Odd_Bloke blackboxsw rharper smoser

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` Previous meeting notes are here

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2020-02-18.html\#status-2020-02-18](https://cloud-init.github.io/status-2020-02-18.html\#status-2020-02-18)

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` he topics we cover in this meeting are the following: Previous Actions, Recent Changes, In-progress Development, Community Charter, Upcoming Meetings, Office Hours (~30 mins).

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` *the even

 16:24 `<Odd_Bloke>` o/

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` \O

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` sorry, have my big head on

 16:24 `<tribaal>` o/

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` :).    Last meeting had no actions carried over. So I think this topic is a noop this week

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` recent changes landed in tip of master via git log --since 2020-02-18  [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/sJVpvjFbPj/](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/sJVpvjFbPj/)

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` we've added some tooling/actions for github, ec2 IMDSv2 token redacting from logs, alloowing kernel cmdline to tell cloud-init network-config=disabled  and not falling back to IMDSv1 on Ec2-proper platform

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` thanks fred-lefebvre for the ec2 IMDS fallback branch and others for some additional driveby doc updates

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` Also, we performed an upload to Ubuntu Focal (20.04) series with latest tip of cloud-init to make sure the development release is up to date with recent features

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` Ubuntu Focal release is currently in feature freeze, so that will affect what patches we pull into Ubuntu Focal at this time as 'new features' would need a Feature Freeze Exception during the stage of Ubuntu development.

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseSchedule](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseSchedule)

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` As Odd_Bloke alluded to just before this meeting, we are trying to keep tip of master

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` open for commits.

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` On the ubuntu-side of the house we will sort cherry picking bug fixes into ubuntu focal during this short feature freeze period of time

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` If there are significant features that your cloud platform really would like to see on the first public release of Ubuntu Focal, then please get ahold of us in channel of on the mailing list to suggest that we shepherd those features in during this freeze.

 16:33 `<blackboxsw>` But, generally cloud-init team will continue to follow the SRU process to get updates into Focal after feature freeze is lifted.

 16:35 `<blackboxsw>` and again, our SRU test/verification process for Ubuntu will continue to target Xenial, Bionic, Eoan and Focal series for the updates we plan to make in the near future

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` one thing to note in recent changes as well is that we've now added the ability to query distro, kernel, cpu arch, python runtime version and and merged cloud-config to cloud-config jinja templates. So \#cloud-config  userdata can be opinionated based on your target distribution or runtime environment.

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/instancedata.html\#format-of-instance-data-json](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/instancedata.html\#format-of-instance-data-json)

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` I think that about wraps recent changes

 16:37 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls)

 16:38 `<blackboxsw>` our active pulls above is probably the best source of info on features/bugfixes in flight.

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` Though behind the scenes we have held a couple of meetings to determine how much more automation/tooling  we need to clean up to improve our github developer process

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` I think Odd_Bloke and I have around 4 PRs that we are hoping to clean up to get a couple of things in place:

 16:40 `<blackboxsw>` foremost I believe Odd_Bloke is scrubbing the github review process PR so that we have a good starting point for expectations for every developer, author or committer.

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` I think ultimately the goal there is to make sure committers can provide a set of expectations on active PR reviews to PR authors, so that active developers get better prioritized reviews.

 16:42 `<blackboxsw>` we are going to add and enable a number of github actions and workflows that should do the following:

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` - age PRs and add labelling to indicate to reviewers and authors that a review needs attention or it will be automatically closed (after around 4 weeks of languishing)

 16:43 `<blackboxsw>` -  label/notify steps to signed the contributor license agreement if unsigned

 16:44 `<blackboxsw>` - run addtional integration tests on active PRs in CI

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` not sure if I am I missing anything else there.

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` but ideally we'd like to find a process that helps upstream unblock PRs and get review comments faster

 16:45 `<blackboxsw>` so, it'll be an iterative process

 16:46 `<blackboxsw>` and thanks for the reviews and suggestions so far on [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/160](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/160) as it is the first cut at trying to document the process

 16:47 `<tribaal>` Nice!

 16:48 `<blackboxsw>` woot. the hope I believe is to land that this week as well as branches like [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/164](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/164) [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/236](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/236) and  [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/125](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/125)

 16:49 `<blackboxsw>` additionally a gap that we still have vs when we hosted in Launchpad, is our auto-merge Launchpad bug commenting/maintenance:

 16:49 `<blackboxsw>` We still have a need for the following:

 16:49 `<blackboxsw>` - comment on LP bugs linking to an open github PR

 16:49 `<blackboxsw>` - comment on merged commitish in github and Fix Commited state when a PR lands in upstream

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` so we'll be tackling that too in order to make upstream maintainers happier and better advertise fixes to bug filers

 16:50 `<blackboxsw>` right now that's all a manual process since we haven't retooled our bug-related tooling

 16:51 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter  and upcoming meeting

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` let's set the status meeting for next session

 16:52 `<blackboxsw>` oops and I realize only now that I blew it this week due to daylight savings... meeting wasn't 'supposed' to start until 25 mins from now : /

 16:53 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic cloud-init pull-requests [https://git.io/JeVed](https://git.io/JeVed) | Meeting minutes: [https://goo.gl/mrHdaj](https://goo.gl/mrHdaj) | Next status meeting March 1 16:15 UTC | 19.4 (Dec 17) drops Py2.7 : origin/stable-19.4 | 20.1 (Feb 18) | [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+filebug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+filebug)

 16:53 `<blackboxsw>` that's better.

 16:53 `<AnhVoMSFT>` it says March 1, is that correct?

 16:54 `<tribaal>` there :)

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` hah, good I got another participant

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` :)

 16:54 `<AnhVoMSFT>` UK will also have their own daylight savings March 29th I believe

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` sorry AnhVoMSFT tribaal :)

 16:54 `<blackboxsw>` yeah this time of year always messes with timing. We try to set things in terms of UTC to avoid thrashing

 16:55 `<blackboxsw>` but even that fails due to human error (my bad)

 16:56 `<blackboxsw>` Other community charter tasks are generally categorized in bugs labelled bitesize

 16:56 `<blackboxsw>` \#link  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs)?field.tag=bitesize

 16:57 `<blackboxsw>` general topics for this year were tasks that are easily done in parallel, such as json schema addtions and datasource readthe docs updates/corrections and fleshing out.

 16:57 `<blackboxsw>` jsonschema example is here for review if anyone wants to take a stab at testing it out. or extending schema for other config modules.[https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/152](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/152)

 16:58 `<blackboxsw>` and again all cloud-init contributors are encouraged to review/comment any active cloud-init PRs  @ [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pulls)  the more voices, the better the quality

 16:58 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next 30 mins)

 16:59 `<blackboxsw>` During this topic, please bring up any questions, discussions, bugs or features or paper cuts that need attention. there should be a couple of cloud-init developers with eyes on the channel to actively respond.

 17:00 `<blackboxsw>` just before the start of this meeting Odd_Bloke was asking about getting the pytest branch landed for cloud-init. (moving off of nosetests as the project is EOL/unmaintained)

 17:00 `<tribaal>` that's nice. pytest is becoming the de-facto standard these days anyway

 17:05 `<blackboxsw>` yeah, didn't want to get stuck using something that becomes unsupported or unsupportable. we don't have the bandwidth in this project to maintain stacks that aren't being looked at by the collective internet ;)

 17:05 `<Odd_Bloke>` blackboxsw: I believe that branch is now only blocked on you removing your "Request changes" review now that we've established that we don't need to hold off on landing things for Feature Freeze.

 17:05 `<tribaal>` makes total sense :)

 17:05 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: do you know if rharper did the new-upstream-snapshot into focal already

 17:05 `<blackboxsw>` to have a 'clean slate' for the pytest branch landing

 17:06 `<Odd_Bloke>` blackboxsw: We can new-upstream-snapshot from an older commit, I don't believe that's a blocker.

 17:06 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: not a blocker, but I could do that now as it's 5 mins

 17:07 `<blackboxsw>` then we can land right aftr

 17:07 `<blackboxsw>` sound good? I see nothing queued [https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/+queue](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/focal/+queue)?queue_state=3&queue_text=cloud-init

 17:08 `<Odd_Bloke>` Sure, if you're happier doing that. :)

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` I aam :)

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` ok doing that right now

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` then we can start the cherry picking just after

 17:10 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: I'm adding this as the debian/changelog section title

 17:10 `<blackboxsw>` * New upstream snapshot: bug-fix-only feature-freeze-exception

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` instead of   * New upstream snapshot:

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` sound reasonable?

 17:11 `<Odd_Bloke>` It isn't bug-fix-only because we have the FFe for a non-bugfix.

 17:12 `<Odd_Bloke>` I was just reading the wiki page that suggested wording, I think, let me take a look.

 17:13 `<blackboxsw>` [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/241](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/241)

 17:13 `<blackboxsw>` ahh right, reviewing that now

 17:13 `<blackboxsw>` yeah not quite sure how to handle our FFe uploads

 17:14 `<Odd_Bloke>` Oh, if it's only that change, then I don't think we need anything specific in the changelog.  We have an FFE bug that we're closing with that upload.

 17:14 * blackboxsw re-reads [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreezeExceptionProcess)

 17:14 `<Odd_Bloke>` And that means it's _definitely_ not bug-fix-only, there isn't a single bugfix in there. ;)

 17:14 `<blackboxsw>` ok that sounds good, will just keep the New upstream snapshot

 17:14 `<blackboxsw>` ok thanks for the review. redoing.

 17:14 `<Odd_Bloke>` Hopefully I'm right and you don't get yelled at. :p

 17:15 `<powersj>` better to upload and ask for forgiveness...

 17:15 `<blackboxsw>` ehh, unlikely :) it seems like steve and others have been pretty lax about changelog text (or manipulating it after the fact) :)

 17:15 `<Odd_Bloke>` Cool, I'll do the same thing locally to review.

 17:16 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: force pushed

 17:16 `<blackboxsw>` [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/241/files](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/241/files)

 17:16 `<Odd_Bloke>` blackboxsw: Approved.

 17:17 `<blackboxsw>` thanks Odd_Bloke

 17:17 `<blackboxsw>` build-and-pushing it up

 17:18 `<blackboxsw>` ok onto your pytest branch now

 17:18 `<blackboxsw>` while I await the ubuntu "accepted" response email

 17:20 `<blackboxsw>` Uploading cloud-init_20.1-10-g71af48df-0ubuntu1.dsc: done.

 17:21 `<blackboxsw>` just waiting on review/acceptance

 17:22 `<blackboxsw>` community-notice: tip of cloud-init published into Ubuntu Focal (20.04) [ubuntu/focal-proposed] cloud-init 20.1-10-g71af48df-0ubuntu1 (Accepted)

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` ok Odd_Bloke merged at long last [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/211](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/211)

 17:26 `<blackboxsw>` nosetest is dead, long live pytest

 17:26 `<Odd_Bloke>` \o/

 17:27 `<Odd_Bloke>` blackboxsw: [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/239](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/239) `<-- another small one for you

 17:29 `<blackboxsw>` approve Odd_Bloke and thanks. it is waiting on you for merge (and CI completion)

 17:30 `<blackboxsw>` works on my focal box

 17:30 `<blackboxsw>` which was broken before

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/164](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/164) is ready for you I think (labeling  in cron)

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` for CLA ! CLA.

 17:33 `<blackboxsw>` or do we want that PR to actually ignore certain paths (like doc changes) as not-requiring CLA

 17:43 `<Goneri>` blackboxsw, could you take a look at [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/62](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/62) Pleaaaase :-)

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` Goneri: yes, and so sorry about that.

 17:44 `<Goneri>` np, and Yeah! for pytest :-D

 17:44 `<blackboxsw>` ... and that about wraps up on our cloud-init status meeting. :) I'll close it out and post the minutes for next time

 17:45 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
