 17:00 `<blackboxsw>` and thanks paride for fixing our CI tests for lxd-based targets

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` I think that about wraps recent-changes.

 17:01 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic  In-progress Development

 17:02 `<blackboxsw>` I was hoping today we'd be able to finally say cloud-init 20.2 has published and released to Ubuntu Xenial. Bionic, Eoan and Focal. All testing is complete, we have unblocked any of this process on our side and we are awaiting an SRU team representative to review and release the bits into Ubuntu proper.

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` We pinged yesterday and a few hour ago again to get this SRU reviewed and released. Expectation is that it will be released to all Ubuntu series today/tonight, so I'd expect that cloud images see that update in the next day or two.

 17:04 `<blackboxsw>` for those watching at home, the folowing bug will be closed as fix-released once cloud-init SRU is published.

 17:04 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1881018](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cloud-init/+bug/1881018)

 17:04 `<ubot5>` Ubuntu bug 1881018 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "sru cloud-init (19.4.33 to 20.2-45) Xenial, Bionic, Eoan and Focal" [Undecided,In progress]

 17:06 `<blackboxsw>` for context, this was a beast of an SRU (as upstream waited too long (~6 months) between to get the SRUs, which involved more verification and complexity. We will make sure to avoid some of this complexity in the future by more frequent SRUs and more requests for community validation I expect.

 17:07 `<blackboxsw>` Also, expect that when this SRU is published, and email will be sent to cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net and a discourse post as well as a "community-notice:"  banned comment

 17:08 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Community Charter

 17:08 `<blackboxsw>` Community driven development  is what helps keep cloud-init active, so that you all for your contributions ( PR reviews, bugs, PR development, discussion etc).

 17:09 `<blackboxsw>` we have a number of general goals we continue to work toward:

 17:10 `<blackboxsw>` - json schema coverage of cloudinit.config.cc_* modules for better error reporting on malformed user-data

 17:10 `<blackboxsw>` - datasource documentation updates and content creation needs

 17:10 `<blackboxsw>` - cloudinit.net refactor into distro-specific networking subclasses cloudinit.distros.networking

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` Bugs associated with that work are available for anyone to own

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` \#link k [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/)?field.tag=bitesize

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs](https://bugs.launchpad.net/cloud-init/+bugs)?field.tag=net-refactor

 17:11 `<blackboxsw>` And details docs on existing refactor are available here

 17:12 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/hacking.html\#ongoing-refactors](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/hacking.html\#ongoing-refactors)

 17:13 `<blackboxsw>` If anyone would like to be involved more than they currently are, please feel free to contact us here in IRC \#cloud-init on Freenode or on the mailing list cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net and we can see how best we can get you "set up"

 17:13 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 mins)

 17:13 `<blackboxsw>` This 'section' of the meeting is a time where a couple of upstream devs will be available in channel for any discussions, questions, bug work or PR reviews.

 17:14 `<blackboxsw>` any topics, bugs, PRs or concerns or rotten fruit to throw are all welcome :). In the absence of dicussion, cloud-init PR reviews are prioritized

 17:18 `<blackboxsw>` Odd_Bloke: can I merge the following as your squashmerge commit message for PR [https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/466](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init/pull/466)      [https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/ZRdq4bYWG7/](https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/ZRdq4bYWG7/)    I think it fixed LP: \#1884626

 17:18 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1884626 in cloud-init "cloudinit.net refactor: wait_for_physdevs" [Low,In progress] [https://launchpad.net/bugs/1884626](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1884626)

 17:31 `<Odd_Bloke>` blackboxsw: You cannot (because I just did ;).

 17:31 `<blackboxsw>` :sad trombone:

 17:43 `<Odd_Bloke>` I just reran the RTD doc build and it passed this time (for anyone else who just got that failure email).

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` Ok I think that about wraps the status meeting

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` thanks for tuning in folks

 17:50 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
