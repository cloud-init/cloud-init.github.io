 16:06 `<blackboxsw>` Welcome to the post-Easter episode of cloud-init's status meeting üê∞

 16:06 `<blackboxsw>` Today's meeting will probably be light as we are fairly light on attendees given various holiday schedules

 16:07 `<rharper>` o/

 16:07 `<rharper>` nice rabbit ears

 16:07 `<blackboxsw>` heya! As always, we'll go through recent changes, in progress work and ~30 minutes of office hours

 16:08 `<blackboxsw>` feel free to interject and ask quesitons at any time.

 16:08 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:09 `<blackboxsw>` Here's a brief run down of what we have committed to master in the last couple weeks

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Support for setting hostname from metadata prior to network bringup.

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` This fixes vsphere multi-vm deployments all coming up with the same

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` 'ubuntu' hostname. [LP: \#1746455]([http://pad.lv/1746455](http://pad.lv/1746455))

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Support initramfs iscsi root so network devices aren't disconnected

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` before shutdown

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Added cloud-config module `cc_snap` which enables loading snap

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` assertions, configuring snapd and installing snap packages on Ubuntu.

 16:10 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1746455 in cloud-init "cloud-init vSphere cloud provider DHCP unique hostname issue" [High,Fix released]

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` Deprecated `cc_snappy` and `cc_snap_config` modules.

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Make salt minion work on FreeBSD (Dominic Schlegel)

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` [LP:\#1721503]([http://pad.lv/1721503](http://pad.lv/1721503))

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Simplify compound conditionals (R√©my L√©one)

 16:10 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1721503 in cloud-init "salt module not able to be used on FreeBSD" [Medium,Fix released]

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Change some list creation and population to literals (R√©my L√©one)

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Add puppet 4 support configurable in `cc_puppet` module (Romanos

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` Skiadas)

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Fix datasouce Azure `get_hostname` function for hostname bounce

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` (Douglas Jordan) [LP:\#1754495]([http://pad.lv/1754495](http://pad.lv/1754495))

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - OpenNebula datasource now uses network config v2 to support IPv6

 16:10 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1755965 in cloud-init (Ubuntu) "duplicate for \#1754495 util.subp regression: no longer accept commands as string" [Critical,Fix released]

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` config (Akihiko Ota)

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` - Add Hetzner Cloud datasource support (Markus Schade)

 16:11 `<blackboxsw>` The highlights of this work that will affect various clouds:   hostname setting before network bringup, in cloud-init's init-local stage.

 16:12 `<blackboxsw>` so if your cloud's metadata provides hostname information (per your instance creation) that hostname gets set before any potential dhcp discovery on the instance. This is a big win for Azure and may allow us to avoid/deprecate some of the hostname_bounce functionality

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` which was baked in to re-dhcp in order to publish updated hostname information to DDNS

 16:14 `<blackboxsw>` We also have landed support for two new clouds: Hetzner Cloud and IBMCloud. A big thanks to Markus Schade for the Hetzner work there and smoser for the IBMCloud datasource

 16:15 `<blackboxsw>` do3meli (Dominic Schlegel) has also been on a blitz fixing and updating a lot of FreeBSD support in cloud-init tip so thank you sir for that work as well.

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` We've just also landed some zfs resize support by rharper as well that should be making it's way into your friendly neighborhood Ubuntu Bionic series in a cloud near you

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` anything else I'm missing on rharper or powersj ?

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` ahh hold the phone

 16:16 `<rharper>` blackboxsw: well, not my zfs-resize

 16:17 `<rharper>` but I do have some fixes for it

 16:17 `<rharper>` [https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/fix/cc_resizefs_on_zfs_root](https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/fix/cc_resizefs_on_zfs_root)

 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` We officially released cloud-init 18.2  in master. There is an 18.2 tag in the repo for folks wanting to take an early cut of it.

 16:17 `<rharper>` our ci-test backend normally runs with zfs, it's not right now so it missed a couple edge cases that we need to handle

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` Per cloud-init 18.2 here is an email sent to the cloud-init mailing list describing the details: [https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00145.html](https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00145.html)

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00145.html](https://lists.launchpad.net/cloud-init/msg00145.html)

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/fix/cc_resizefs_on_zfs_root](https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/fix/cc_resizefs_on_zfs_root)

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` The upstream team has released 18,2 to Bionic as of last week, and we started an Ubuntu SRU process into Xenial and Artful.

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` We expect the 18.2 to be present in Xenial and Artful within 2 weeks in your cloud, so if you are waiting on a feature, it won't be very long.

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` Also in-progress are some of rharper's zfs fixes, and some exception callback cleanup that will affect Azure, EC2, OpenStack and  Scaleway clouds.

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#link  [https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/fix/cc_resizefs_on_zfs_root](https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+ref/fix/cc_resizefs_on_zfs_root)

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/342007](https://code.launchpad.net/~smoser/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/342007)

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` And we are doing our part to finally purge net-tools dependencies from cloud-init (in favor of iproute2)

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/342428](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/342428)

 16:24 `<rharper>` blackboxsw: I responded to your ip -6 route q from last week, did you see that ?

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` rharper: haven't yet, but I'll grab those comments today for sure (I think I missed some of your earlier review comments)

 16:24 `<rharper>` ok

 16:25 `<rharper>` the tl;dr for that one is that you want this: ip -6 route list table all

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` ahh excellent, I was wondering why we were missing content for local routes etc

 16:25 `<rharper>` right

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` thanks

 16:25 `<rharper>` np

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` also, on our continuous integration front , powersj  has put up a branch that I'd like to see us land with some ssh improvements

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~powersj/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/342010](https://code.launchpad.net/~powersj/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/342010)

 16:26 `<powersj>` :) yep

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` any other in-progress work worth noting?

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` Intereseted parties can always track our public trello board for a glimpse of what we are working on

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:27 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hours (next ~30 minutes)

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` We'll all have eyes glued to the screen for the next 30 minutes for rants, feature discussion and bug work.

 16:29 `<blackboxsw>` With that, the floor is open for any topics. Thanks for tuning in.

 16:30 `<blackboxsw>` My day today will be Ubuntu SRU(stable release update)-related, so I'm getting on rharper's zfs branch now and they running a couple manual tests on ec2/azure/openstack

 16:30 `<rharper>` +1

 16:30 `<rharper>` oh, the ntp-spec update is ready for review and testing

 16:31 `<rharper>` [https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/339438](https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/339438)

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` ahh +1 we want that in too

 16:32 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/339438](https://code.launchpad.net/~raharper/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/339438)

 17:02 `<blackboxsw>` Alrighty, happy spring break all.

 17:02 `<blackboxsw>` Next meeting will be two weeks from today.

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` powersj: rharper 4/16 look good for folks?

 17:03 `<powersj>` +1 from me

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` \#endmeeting
