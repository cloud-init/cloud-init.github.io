 16:04 `<blackboxsw>` \#startmeeting Cloud-init bi-weekly status meeting

 16:04 `<meetingology>` Meeting started Mon Aug  6 16:04:05 2018 UTC.  The chair is blackboxsw. Information about MeetBot at [http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.](http://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology.)

 16:04 `<blackboxsw>` hi folks, let's kickoff another cloud-init status meeting. Welcome back. Lot's of summer vacations disrupting our typical meeting schedule.

 16:05 `<blackboxsw>` Our last meeting's minutes should be up on our github site

 16:05 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://cloud-init.github.io/](https://cloud-init.github.io/)

 16:07 `<blackboxsw>` for this meeting we'll go through the following topics: previous actions, recent work, in-progress development and office hours

 16:09 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Previous Actions

 16:09 `<blackboxsw>` from our last meeting we had a couple of actions to carry over

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` we landed the folowing branch which added support for a datasource to re-write network config across each boot.  [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/348000](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/348000)

 16:10 `<blackboxsw>` the above is still a carryover

 16:11 `<blackboxsw>` that's all for actions from last meeting

 16:11 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Recent Changes

 16:12 `<blackboxsw>` the following has landed in cloud-init tip:

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * oracle: fix detect_openstack to report True on OracleCloud.com DMI data (LP: \#1784685)

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * tests: improve LXDInstance trying to workaround or catch bug.*

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * update_metadata re-config on every boot comments and tests not quite right [Mike Gerdts]

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * docs: note in rtd about avoiding /tmp when writing files

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * ubuntu,centos,debian: get_linux_distro to align with platform.dist

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * Fix boothook docs on environment variable name (INSTANCE_I ->` INSTANCE_ID) (Marc Tamsky)

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * update_metadata: a datasource can support network re-config every boot

 16:13 `<ubot5>` Launchpad bug 1784685 in cloud-init "Oracle: cloud-init openstack local detection too strict for oracle cloud" [High,Fix committed] [https://launchpad.net/bugs/1784685](https://launchpad.net/bugs/1784685)

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * tests: drop salt-minion integration test

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * Retry on failed import of gpg receive keys.

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * tools: Fix run-container when neither source or binary package requested.

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * docs: Fix a small spelling error (Oz N Tiram)

 16:13 `<blackboxsw>` * tox: use simplestreams from git repository rather than bzr.

 16:14 `<blackboxsw>` generally speaking we had been spending some cycles on a stable release update (SRU) for cloud-init into Xenial and Bionic with top of tree cloud-init.

 16:15 `<blackboxsw>` notably, we discovered a potential regression in Oracle datasource detection of their OpenStack implementation so that fix is queued for publish into xenial and bionic

 16:15 `<blackboxsw>` 18.3-9 is what folks are looking for. in xenial/bionic/cosmic for latest cloud-init containing all the above fixes

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` Also powersj has been working on an auto-lander for cloud-init branches to get a few of us out of the way once a branch hits acceptm

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` Also powersj has been working on an auto-lander for cloud-init branches to get a few of us out of the way once a branch hits "Approved" status.

 16:16 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/job/admin-lp-git-autoland/](https://jenkins.ubuntu.com/server/job/admin-lp-git-autoland/)

 16:16 `<powersj>` yep that is live and with a recent fix to remove the extra "Author" line now

 16:16 `<powersj>` hopefully it is saving blackboxsw, smoser, and rharper time ;)

 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` powersj: can you explain what it does (so I don't have to type)

 16:17 `<blackboxsw>` :)

 16:17 `<powersj>` If a merge request is put in the "Approved" state, it will get test merged with the master branch

 16:17 `<powersj>` the tests will run the same as during a review and verify that it can merge cleanly

 16:18 `<powersj>` the commit message will get linted to verify it fits our format

 16:18 `<powersj>` and if everything looks good, get merged in and pushed to master

 16:18 `<blackboxsw>` thanks for that work powersj. it looks/works great so far.

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic In-progress Development

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` All our current work is visible at the following trello board

 16:19 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin](https://trello.com/b/hFtWKUn3/daily-cloud-init-curtin)

 16:20 `<blackboxsw>` I expect we'll have a couple of branches landed shortly in the following areas:

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - smoser is working: A datasource specific to Oracle, because of their specific implementation of Openstack. Oracle will no longer use just stock DataSourceOpenStack.

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - I

 16:21 `<blackboxsw>` - I'm trying to wrap up a branch for Azure to write network data from their IMDS per-boot

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/348704](https://code.launchpad.net/~chad.smith/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/348704)

 16:22 `<blackboxsw>` - Joyent (SmartOS) per-boot network config review

 16:23 `<blackboxsw>` - a couple netplan config option bugs for bionic ++

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` - and standardize instance-data sourcing in \#cloud-config files (like referencing the hostname as detected from instance metadata)

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` I think that probably wraps it up for stuff in progress

 16:24 `<blackboxsw>` anything I'm missing?

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` ... without further ado

 16:25 `<blackboxsw>` \#topic Office Hource (next ~30 mins)

 16:26 `<blackboxsw>` eyes will float on this channel for any bug/feature discussions, review requests  etc. any cloud-init topic is acceptable.

 16:28 `<blackboxsw>` a number of us are going to be prepping for a cloud-init summit meeting in the weeks to come.  A number of attendees from various vendors and clouds are attending as well to do a bit of planning on what cloud-init should look like next year. If folks get a chance, think about any feature or topic suggestions that would benefit cloud-init users and we'll see if we can discuss them at the summit.

 16:31 `<blackboxsw>` while I'm at it, I think I'll set the topic to next status meeting time so folks know it's coming.

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` also just noticed the following branch, which admitedly is a bit stale, but adds hyperv logging via kvp. kinda cool for stuffing data into the registry on windows vms. Might have to get a review on that before the next status meeting.

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` \#link [https://code.launchpad.net/~andyliuliming/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/351742.](https://code.launchpad.net/~andyliuliming/cloud-init/+git/cloud-init/+merge/351742.)

 16:39 `<blackboxsw>` it looks a bit noisy on the debug front with adding out/err messages for all subp calls, but other than that fairly straight forward.

 17:03 `<blackboxsw>` looks like that's a wrap for today.

 17:04 `<blackboxsw>` see you next time: 2 weeks from today
